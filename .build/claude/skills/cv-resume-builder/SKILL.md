## Quantification Guide

### Metrics to Include

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Scale | Users, transactions, revenue, team size |
| Improvement | % increase/decrease, before→after |
| Efficiency | Time saved, cost reduced, speed improved |
| Quality | Error rate, satisfaction score, accuracy |
| Frequency | Daily/weekly/monthly volume |

### When You Don't Have Numbers

- Estimate reasonably: "approximately," "over," "nearly"
- Use relative scale: "largest," "first," "only"
- Describe scope: "company-wide," "cross-functional," "enterprise"
- Note recognition: "selected for," "promoted to," "awarded"

---

## ATS Optimization

### Do's

- Use standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Include keywords from job description
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times)
- Save as .docx or .pdf (check requirements)
- Use simple formatting (no tables, columns, graphics)
- Spell out acronyms at least once

### Don'ts

- Headers/footers (often not parsed)
- Text boxes or images
- Fancy fonts or colors
- Complex tables or columns
- Only acronyms without spelled-out versions

### Keyword Strategy

1. Extract keywords from 3-5 similar job postings
2. Identify frequency (common = important)
3. Include exact phrases where authentic
4. Place in Skills section and naturally in Experience
5. Match their terminology (e.g., "Agile" vs "agile methodology")

## Tailoring Strategy

### Per-Application Customization

| Element | Customization Level |
|---------|---------------------|
| Summary | High - rewrite for each role |
| Experience bullets | Medium - reorder, emphasize relevant |
| Skills | High - match job requirements |
| Job titles | Low - keep honest, can clarify |
| Education | Low - standard unless relevant |

### Tailoring Checklist

- [ ] Summary addresses their specific needs
