# Peer Review Guides

## General Peer Review Protocol

1. Read the entire draft without marking anything
2. Read again with the guide, making notes
3. Write your feedback—be specific, kind, and constructive
4. Discuss with the writer (if time allows)

**Feedback Principles:**
- Describe what you see before evaluating
- Ask questions rather than giving commands
- Point to specific passages
- Balance strengths and areas for growth
- Focus on higher-order concerns first (ideas, organization) before lower-order (grammar)
