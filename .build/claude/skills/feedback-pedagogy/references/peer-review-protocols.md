# Peer Review Protocols

Structured peer review activities for different contexts, class sizes, and learning goals.

---

## Gallery Walk Protocol

Students post work on walls (or shared docs) and circulate with sticky notes.

### Setup

1. Students display work at stations around the room
2. Provide sticky notes in two colors (e.g., green for strengths, yellow for suggestions)
3. Set a timer for each rotation (3-5 minutes per station)

### Instructions for Reviewers

- Read the full piece before writing anything
- Write one specific strength (green note)
- Write one constructive suggestion (yellow note)
- Sign your note (builds accountability)
- Move to the next station when the timer sounds

### Debrief

After all rotations, students return to their own work and:
1. Read all feedback received
2. Group notes by theme
3. Identify the most actionable suggestion
4. Write a brief revision plan

Best for: Visual/creative work, short writing pieces, brainstorming artifacts. Works well with classes of 15-30.

## Structured Peer Conference (Pairs)

A focused 15-20 minute conversation between two students.

| Step | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| Writer reads | 3-5 min | Read the piece aloud (listener follows silently) |
| Listener reflects | 1 min | Say back the main argument in own words |
| Writer asks | 1 min | Pose one specific question about the draft |
| Discussion | 5-7 min | Listener responds, then offers observations |
| Writer summarizes | 2 min | State top takeaway and next revision step |

### Sentence Starters for Listeners

- "The main argument I'm hearing is..."
- "The strongest evidence you used was..."
- "I got confused when..."
- "One thing you could try is..."

Best for: Argumentative essays, research papers, longer drafts where detailed conversation matters.

## Stars and Stairs Protocol

A quick, low-stakes protocol suitable for younger students or first-time peer reviewers.

Each reviewer provides:
- **Two stars**: Two specific things the writer did well
- **One stair**: One specific area for improvement (framed as a "next step")

### Template

```markdown
Writer: _______________
Reviewer: _______________

Star 1: _____________________________________________
Star 2: _____________________________________________
Stair:  _____________________________________________
```

Best for: Elementary through early secondary, peer review newcomers, formative low-stakes drafts.

## TAG Protocol (Tell, Ask, Give)

A three-part structured response that balances observation, inquiry, and advice.

1. **Tell** the writer something you liked (be specific)
2. **Ask** the writer a question about their work
3. **Give** the writer a suggestion for improvement

| Step | Weak Example | Strong Example |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Tell | "I liked it" | "Your opening anecdote about the rainstorm drew me in immediately" |
| Ask | "Why did you write this?" | "In paragraph 3, what do you mean by 'systemic failure'?" |
| Give | "Make it longer" | "Adding a counterargument before your conclusion would strengthen your position" |

Best for: Middle school through university, all writing genres, quick formative feedback rounds.

## Fishbowl Review

A whole-class protocol where a small group models peer review while others observe.

1. Select 3-4 volunteer reviewers to sit in the center (fishbowl)
2. Share one anonymous student draft with the whole class
3. Everyone reads silently (3 min), then the inner circle discusses aloud (10 min)
4. Outer circle observers note effective feedback moves they hear
5. Whole-class debrief (5 min): What feedback was most helpful? Why?

Best for: Teaching peer review skills before asking students to do it independently. Particularly useful early in the term.

---

## Round-Robin Written Response

Each draft circulates through multiple reviewers so the writer gets diverse perspectives.

1. Form groups of 4 students
2. Each student passes their draft to the right
3. Set a timer (5-7 minutes per round)

| Round | Reviewer Focuses On |
|-------|---------------------|
| 1 | Thesis and main argument |
| 2 | Evidence and support |
| 3 | Organization and flow |

Each reviewer marks the draft: underline the thesis, "+" next to strongest evidence, "?" next to confusing passages, and 2-3 sentences of feedback focused on their assigned area.

Best for: Ensuring feedback on multiple dimensions. Works well for essays and research papers in classes of 12-32.

---

## Digital Adaptations

- **Shared docs**: Use suggestion mode or track changes. Assign comment prefixes: `[STRENGTH]`, `[QUESTION]`, `[SUGGESTION]`
- **Discussion boards**: Post drafts as threads with a structured reply template (summary, strongest moment, question, suggestion)
- **Calibration exercise**: Before live review, have everyone independently review the same sample draft, then compare and discuss what makes feedback helpful

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "It's good" (no substance) | Lack of vocabulary | Provide sentence starters and model examples |
| Overly harsh feedback | No norms established | Set norms explicitly; use Stars and Stairs first |
| Students ignore feedback | No accountability | Require a revision memo citing peer feedback used |
| Unequal effort | Free-rider dynamics | Grade feedback quality with a rubric (see rubric-templates.md) |
| Students distrust peers | Lack of calibration | Run fishbowl or calibration exercises first |
