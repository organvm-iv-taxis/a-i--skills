| Eligibility | Do you meet requirements? | Critical |
| Track Record | Have they funded similar work? | Important |
| Timing | Does your timeline match? | Important |
| Competition | What's the funding rate? | Consider |

## Writing Strategies

### For Reviewers

Remember:
- Reviewers are busy
- They may not be experts in YOUR area
- They're looking for reasons to fund AND reject
- Clear writing signals clear thinking

### Structure Signals

Use headers, white space, bold:
```
**Problem**: Clear statement of the issue.

**Approach**: How we'll address it.

**Outcome**: What will result.
```

### Strong vs Weak Writing

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "We hope to..." | "We will..." |
| "This may lead to..." | "This will produce..." |
| "It is believed that..." | "Research shows that..." |
| "Various methods..." | "Three specific methods: A, B, C..." |
| "Significant impact..." | "40% reduction in..." |

### The "So What" Test

Every claim should answer:
- Why does this matter?
- To whom does this matter?
- What changes if this succeeds?
