# Interfaith Sacred Geometry

Create geometrically precise, spiritually meaningful visualizations honoring multiple traditions.

## Core Philosophy

Sacred geometry reveals universal patterns underlying all traditions. This skill treats no tradition as superior—each offers a unique lens on the same underlying mathematical harmonies.

**Guiding principles:**
- Mathematical precision serves spiritual authenticity
- Symbols carry weight—use them with reverence
- Harmony emerges from genuine understanding, not superficial mixing

## Universal Patterns

These forms appear across traditions:

| Pattern | Significance |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Unity, wholeness, divine perfection |
| Triangle | Trinity, ascent, transformation |
| Square | Earth, stability, material world |
| Hexagon | Balance of opposites, harmony |
| Spiral | Growth, journey, evolution |
| Cross | Intersection of dimensions, sacrifice |
| Star | Divine light, guidance, hope |

## Tradition-Specific Symbols

### Abrahamic Traditions

**Judaism**
- Star of David (hexagram): Unity of divine masculine/feminine
- Menorah: Tree of Life, divine light
- Hebrew letters: Kabbalistic significance (Aleph, Shin, Mem)

**Christianity**
- Cross variations: Latin, Greek, Celtic, Orthodox
- Chi-Rho: Christ monogram
- Ichthys: Early Christian fish symbol
- Trinity knot: Three-in-one

**Islam**
- 8-pointed star (Rub el Hizb): Cosmic order
- Arabesque patterns: Infinite divine nature
- Calligraphic forms: Allah, Bismillah
- Geometric tessellations: Divine unity in multiplicity

### Eastern Traditions

**Hinduism**
- Om (ॐ): Primordial sound
- Sri Yantra: 9 interlocking triangles, goddess energy
- Lotus: Spiritual unfoldment
- Chakra symbols: Energy centers

**Buddhism**
- Endless Knot: Interdependence, wisdom-compassion
- Dharma Wheel: Noble Eightfold Path
- Lotus: Enlightenment from suffering
- Mandala: Cosmic diagram

**Taoism**
- Yin-Yang: Complementary opposites
- Bagua: Eight trigrams
- Taijitu variations: Dynamic balance

### Indigenous & Other Traditions

- Medicine Wheel: Four directions, wholeness
- Labyrinth: Sacred journey inward
- Tree of Life: Universal across traditions
- Spiral petroglyphs: Cosmic journey

## Compositional Approaches

### Layered Harmony

Stack symbols concentrically:

```
Layer 1 (center): Shared symbol (circle, point)
Layer 2: First tradition's geometry
Layer 3: Second tradition's geometry
Layer 4: Third tradition's geometry
Outer: Universal pattern (flower of life, spiral)
```

### Radial Arrangement

Place symbols at equal angles around center:

```
6 traditions → 60° spacing
7 traditions → 51.43° spacing
8 traditions → 45° spacing
12 traditions → 30° spacing
```

### Geometric Mediation

Find geometric common ground:

- Hexagram connects Star of David + Hindu yantra triangles
- 8-pointed star bridges Islamic geometry + Buddhist wheel
- Spiral unifies all traditions through growth metaphor

## Color Symbolism

### Cross-Cultural Color Meanings

| Color | Common Associations | Cautions |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| Gold | Divine, sacred (universal) | Overuse feels gaudy |
| White | Purity, light | Death in some Eastern contexts |
| Blue | Heaven, spirit, truth | Varies by shade |
| Green | Growth, Islam, nature | |
| Red | Life, sacrifice, passion | Danger in Western contexts |
| Purple | Royalty, mysticism | |
| Black | Mystery, void, depth | Death in Western contexts |

### Chakra-Based Palettes

```
Root (Red) → Sacral (Orange) → Solar (Yellow) → 
Heart (Green) → Throat (Blue) → Third Eye (Indigo) → 
Crown (Violet/White)
```

## Mathematical Foundations

See `references/sacred-math.md` for:
- Golden ratio applications
- Platonic solid relationships
- Vesica piscis constructions
- Fibonacci spiral generation
- Sacred number systems (3, 7, 12, 40, 108)

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Intent**: Define spiritual purpose and traditions to honor
2. **Research**: Verify symbol meanings and appropriate usage
3. **Geometry**: Calculate precise mathematical relationships
4. **Composition**: Arrange elements with visual and spiritual harmony
5. **Color**: Apply colors respecting symbolic meanings
6. **Review**: Consider if any tradition would find use offensive

## Cautions

- **Avoid appropriation**: Research before using unfamiliar symbols
- **Respect restrictions**: Some symbols have usage rules (Om, certain mandalas)
- **Context matters**: Sacred symbols in commercial contexts can offend
- **Consult practitioners**: When possible, verify with tradition members
