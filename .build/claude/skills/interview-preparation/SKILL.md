Result: Outcome achieved
```

| Achievement | Proudest accomplishment, exceeded expectations |
| Initiative | Self-started project, identified opportunity |
| Collaboration | Cross-functional work, built relationships |
| Problem-solving | Ambiguous situation, creative solution |
| Growth | Learned new skill, received feedback, adapted |

## Salary Negotiation

### Research Phase

- Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Payscale for ranges

- Know your minimum, target, and stretch numbers

### Negotiation Principles

1. **Don't give a number first** (if possible)
2. **Anchor high** (within reason)
3. **Negotiate the whole package** (base, equity, bonus, benefits, start date)
4. **Get it in writing**
5. **Be gracious** regardless of outcome

### Scripts

**When asked for expectations early**:
> "I'm focused on finding the right fit. I'm confident we can find something that works if we're aligned on the role. What's the range budgeted for this position?"

**Responding to an offer**:
> "Thank you, I'm excited about this opportunity. I'd like to take some time to review the full package. When do you need a response?"

**Counter-offering**:
> "I'm very excited about joining [Company]. Based on my research and the value I'll bring, I was hoping for [X]. Is there flexibility there?"

**If they can't move on salary**:
> "I understand the constraints. Are there other elements we could discuss—signing bonus, equity, PTO, start date, or title?"
