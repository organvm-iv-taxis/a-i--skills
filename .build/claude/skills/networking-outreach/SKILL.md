# Networking Outreach

Build genuine professional relationships at scale.

## Networking Philosophy

### The Mindset Shift

| Transactional | Relational |
|---------------|------------|
| "What can you do for me?" | "How can I be useful?" |
| One-time ask | Ongoing relationship |
| Immediate need | Long-term investment |
| Extract value | Create value |

### The Give-First Principle

Before asking for anything:
- Share relevant content
- Make introductions
- Offer help or expertise
- Engage with their work

---

## Outreach Strategy

### Target Identification

| Category | Who | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **Direct targets** | Hiring managers, recruiters | Decision makers |
| **Warm connections** | Alumni, former colleagues | Shared context |
| **Industry peers** | Similar role, different company | Mutual learning |
| **Thought leaders** | Content creators, speakers | Visibility + learning |
| **Connectors** | Well-networked individuals | Access to network |

### Research Before Outreach

For each person:
- Current role and company
- Career path
- Shared connections
- Recent content/achievements
- Potential common ground

## Cold Email Framework

### The AIDA Structure

```
Attention: Hook that earns the read
Interest: Why you're reaching out
Desire: What's in it for them / credibility
Action: Clear, easy ask
```

### Cold Email Template

```
Subject: [Specific, relevant, not clickbait]

Hi [Name],

[One sentence showing you did research—specific to them]

[Why you're reaching out—be direct]

[Brief credibility—why you, why now]

[Specific, low-commitment ask]

[Graceful out—acknowledge they're busy]

Best,
[Your name]
[One-line signature]
```

### Example: Informational Interview Request

```
Subject: Quick question about [their specialty] at [Company]

Hi Sarah,

I came across your post about migrating to microservices at Stripe—
the part about managing tech debt during the transition resonated 
with challenges I'm facing.

I'm a senior engineer exploring platform roles, and Stripe's 
infrastructure work is particularly interesting to me.

Would you have 20 minutes for a call? I'd love to hear how you 
approached [specific thing]. Happy to work around your schedule.

No worries if you're swamped—I know these requests add up.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Subject Line Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Mutual connection | "Alex Chen suggested I reach out" |
| Specific reference | "Your talk on X at Y" |
| Direct ask | "Quick question about [topic]" |
| Shared context | "Fellow [school] alum in [field]" |
| Value offer | "Resource on [topic you discussed]" |

### What NOT to Do

❌ Generic templates with no personalization
❌ Long emails (>150 words for cold)
❌ Asking for a job directly
❌ No clear ask
❌ Attachments on first email
❌ Following up aggressively

## LinkedIn Strategy

### Profile Optimization

- **Headline**: Not just title—value proposition
- **About**: First person, story-driven, keywords
- **Experience**: Accomplishments, not duties
- **Featured**: Best work, portfolio links
- **Activity**: Regular engagement

### Connection Requests

```
Hi [Name],

[One sentence of context—how you found them, what you have in common]

[Why you want to connect—specific, genuine]

[Name]
```

**Example**:
```
Hi Marcus,

I saw your comment on Lenny's post about PLG metrics—your point 
about activation vs. engagement really clarified something I've 
been wrestling with.

Would love to connect and follow your thinking on product growth.

[Name]
```

### Engagement Strategy

**Daily** (5-10 min):
- Comment thoughtfully on 2-3 posts
- React to content from targets

**Weekly** (30 min):
- Post original content or insight
- Send 3-5 connection requests
- Message 2-3 existing connections

**Quality Comments**:
- Add insight, not just agreement
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Share relevant experience
- Tag when genuinely relevant

---

## Informational Interviews

### The Ask

Keep it specific and low-commitment:
- 15-20 minutes (not 30)
- Phone/video (their preference)
- Flexible on timing
- Clear topic

### Preparation

- Research their background thoroughly
- Prepare 5-7 questions
- Know what you want to learn
- Have your own story ready

### Question Framework

**Career Path**:
- "How did you get into [field]?"
- "What led you from [A] to [B]?"

**Role Insight**:
- "What does a typical week look like?"
- "What surprised you about this role?"

**Industry/Company**:
- "What trends are you watching?"
- "What's the culture really like?"

**Advice**:
- "What would you do differently?"
- "What should I be learning?"

**Closing**:
- "Who else should I talk to?"
- "How can I be helpful to you?"

### During the Call

- Be on time (early)
- Let them talk (80/20)
- Take notes
- Watch the time
- Ask for referrals naturally
- Offer value if you can

### After the Call

- Thank you email within 24 hours
- Connect on LinkedIn if not already
- Follow up on anything discussed
- Stay in touch (content shares, updates)

---

## Follow-Up Sequences

### After No Response (Cold)

```
Day 0: Initial email
Day 4-5: Bump email
Day 10-14: Final follow-up with new angle
```

**Bump Email**:
```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up in case it got buried. 

[One new sentence of value or context]

[Name]
```

**Final Follow-Up**:
```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

I'll assume now isn't a good time. No worries at all.

If things change, I'd still love to connect about [topic].

Best,
[Name]
```

### After Informational Interview

```
Day 0: Thank you email
Week 2-4: Share relevant article/resource
Month 1-2: Update on your progress
Ongoing: Engage with their content
```

### After Job Application

```
Day 0: Apply
Day 3-5: Reach out to hiring manager/recruiter
Day 10: Follow up if no response
Post-interview: Same day thank you
```
