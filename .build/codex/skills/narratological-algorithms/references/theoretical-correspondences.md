## Usage Guidelines

1. **Not all concepts map directly** — Use "—" for no equivalent
2. **Similar ≠ Identical** — Note significant differences in usage
3. **Context matters** — Same term may have different scope across traditions
4. **Primary sources trump** — When in doubt, defer to original text
5. **Update as needed** — Add rows/columns as new creators are analyzed
