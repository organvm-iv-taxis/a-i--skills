## Opportunity Landscape

### Opportunity Scoring Matrix

| Outcome | Importance (I) | Satisfaction (S) | Opportunity Score |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [Outcome 1] | [1-10] | [1-10] | [I + max(I-S, 0)] |
| [Outcome 2] | [1-10] | [1-10] | [I + max(I-S, 0)] |
| [Outcome 3] | [1-10] | [1-10] | [I + max(I-S, 0)] |

**Scoring Formula**: Opportunity = Importance + max(Importance - Satisfaction, 0)

**Interpretation**:
- **>15**: Underserved—high opportunity for innovation
- **12-15**: Moderately underserved—worth exploring
- **10-12**: Appropriately served—incremental opportunity
- **<10**: Overserved—avoid investment
