# Security Essentials Pack

A curated bundle of essential security skills for building and maintaining secure applications. This pack integrates threat analysis, hardening practices, compliance frameworks, and audit procedures into a comprehensive security toolkit.

## What's Included

- **security-threat-modeler** - Systematic security analysis using STRIDE methodology
- **security-implementation-guide** - Security hardening patterns and implementation guidance
- **gdpr-compliance-check** - GDPR compliance assessment and data protection validation
- **incident-response-commander** - Security incident response coordination and playbooks
- **contract-risk-analyzer** - Vendor contract and third-party risk analysis

## Getting Started

Install this bundle to establish security practices across your projects. Begin with threat modeling to understand your attack surface, then apply hardening techniques to your architecture and code. Use audit checklists to validate security measures, compliance mappers to meet regulatory requirements, and contract analyzers to manage third-party risks.

This pack works for teams of any size establishing security programs or improving existing security postures.
