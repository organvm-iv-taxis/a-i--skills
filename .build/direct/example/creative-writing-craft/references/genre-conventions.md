# Genre Conventions

Reader expectations, structural norms, and common pitfalls by genre.

## Why Genre Matters

Genre is a contract with the reader. Readers pick up a thriller expecting tension and pace; a romance expecting emotional payoff. You can bend conventions, but breaking them without purpose loses trust.

**The rule**: Know the conventions before you subvert them.

---

## Literary Fiction

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Character interiority, thematic depth |
| Pacing | Slower, contemplative |
| Prose | Elevated, stylistically distinct |
| Endings | Ambiguous, bittersweet, earned |
| Word count | 60,000-100,000 |

**Reader expects**: Insight into the human condition, beautiful sentences, emotional resonance.

**Common pitfalls**: All style and no story; characters who think but never act; themes stated rather than dramatized.

## Thriller / Suspense

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | External conflict, escalating danger |
| Pacing | Fast, relentless, short chapters |
| Structure | Ticking clock, twists every 30-50 pages |
| POV | Often multiple POVs, alternating timeline |
| Word count | 70,000-100,000 |

**Reader expects**: Tension on every page, stakes that escalate, a satisfying twist they did not see coming but should have.

**Common pitfalls**: Implausible villain plans; protagonist who is passive; twists that cheat (information withheld unfairly); sagging middle act.

### Thriller Pacing Pattern

```
Hook (danger) → Brief relief → Escalation → Clue/Reveal →
Greater danger → False resolution → Final twist → Climax
```

## Mystery / Crime

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Puzzle, investigation, justice |
| Structure | Crime occurs early, clues planted throughout |
| Fair play | Reader must have access to the same clues as the detective |
| Red herrings | Misdirection without cheating |
| Word count | 60,000-90,000 |

**Reader expects**: A solvable puzzle, satisfying reveal, justice (or meaningful injustice).

**Common pitfalls**: Clues too obscure or too obvious; the killer introduced in the last chapter; forensic details that strain credibility.

### Knox's Commandments (Classic Mystery)

1. The criminal must be mentioned early
2. No supernatural solutions
3. No secret rooms or passages (unless established)
4. No undiscovered poisons or technology
5. No stereotyped characters as the solution

## Romance

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Central love story between protagonists |
| Structure | Meet → Attraction → Obstacles → Black moment → HEA/HFN |
| Requirement | Happy ending (HEA) or Happy For Now (HFN) is mandatory |
| POV | Dual POV common (both love interests) |
| Word count | 50,000-100,000 |

**Reader expects**: Emotional satisfaction, chemistry between leads, earned intimacy, a happy ending.

**Common pitfalls**: Conflict based on miscommunication alone; one-dimensional love interest; no obstacles beyond "they just haven't talked yet."

### Heat Levels

| Level | Description | Content |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Sweet | No explicit content | Closed door, fade to black |
| Warm | Some sensuality | Kissing, emotional intimacy |
| Hot | Explicit scenes | On-page sex, detailed |
| Erotic | Frequent explicit content | Sex drives plot |

---

## Science Fiction

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Ideas, technology, society, what-if |
| Worldbuilding | Internally consistent speculative elements |
| Exposition | Integrated, not lecture-style |
| Science | At least plausible within the story's rules |
| Word count | 80,000-120,000 |

**Reader expects**: A compelling speculative premise explored rigorously, consistent world rules, sense of wonder.

**Common pitfalls**: Worldbuilding dumps that stop the story; technology as magic without consequences; ignoring social implications of the premise.

---

## Fantasy

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Magic, secondary worlds, mythic narrative |
| Worldbuilding | Deep and consistent (magic systems, cultures, history) |
| Magic | Must have rules and costs |
| Stakes | Often epic (world-level), but personal stakes anchor it |
| Word count | 90,000-150,000 (epic can run longer) |

**Reader expects**: Immersive world, consistent magic, mythic or heroic narrative arc.

**Sanderson's Laws**:
1. An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is proportional to how well the reader understands the magic
2. Limitations are more interesting than powers
3. Expand what you already have before adding something new

---

## Horror

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Fear, dread, the unknown |
| Pacing | Slow build of dread, punctuated by shock |
| Atmosphere | Setting as character; darkness, isolation, wrongness |
| Threat | Often ambiguous or incomprehensible |
| Word count | 60,000-90,000 |

**Reader expects**: Genuine unease, escalating dread, a threat that feels inescapable.

**Types of fear**:

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Terror | Anticipation of threat | Something is behind the door |
| Horror | Confrontation with threat | The door opens |
| Revulsion | Physical disgust | What came through the door |

**Common pitfalls**: Over-explaining the monster; jump scares without buildup; nihilistic endings without thematic purpose.

---

## Historical Fiction

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Story set in a documented historical period |
| Research | Period-accurate details (material culture, language, social norms) |
| Language | Evocative of period without being archaic |
| Balance | History serves story, not the reverse |
| Word count | 80,000-120,000 |

**Reader expects**: Transportation to another era, authentic period feel, historical accuracy in major details.

**Common pitfalls**: Modern values projected onto historical characters; research overwhelming narrative; anachronistic language or technology.

---

## Genre Blending

Successful blends honor the core promises of each genre.

| Blend | Primary Promise | Secondary Promise |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Romantic Suspense | Tension, danger | Love story with HEA |
| Science Fantasy | Sense of wonder | Mythic narrative |
| Historical Mystery | Period immersion | Fair-play puzzle |
| Literary Thriller | Page-turning pace | Thematic depth |
| Horror Romance | Emotional payoff | Genuine dread |

**Key principle**: Identify which genre's ending convention dominates. A romantic suspense must end happily. A literary thriller can end ambiguously.
