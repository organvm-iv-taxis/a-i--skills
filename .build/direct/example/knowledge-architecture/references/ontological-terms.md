# Ontological Terms for Knowledge Architecture

## Fundamental Categories

### Being (τὸ ὄν / to on)
That which is. The broadest category—anything that exists or can be thought.

### Substance (οὐσία / ousia)
That which exists in itself, not as a property of something else. The bearer of properties. 

In knowledge systems: **Primary entities**—projects, people, tools, works.

### Accident (συμβεβηκός / symbebekos)
That which belongs to a substance but is not essential to it. Could be otherwise.

In knowledge systems: **Metadata, tags, current states**—things that change without changing identity.

### Essence (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι / to ti ēn einai)
"The what it was to be"—what makes a thing that thing and not something else.

In knowledge systems: **Core definition**—the irreducible description.

### Property (ἴδιον / idion)
Something that belongs to all instances of a kind, even if not part of the essence.

In knowledge systems: **Inherited attributes**—all projects have status, all works have creators.

## Relations

### Genus (γένος / genos)
The broader category to which a thing belongs.

Example: "Software Project" is a genus; "CLI Tool" is a species within it.

### Species (εἶδος / eidos)
A subdivision of a genus, defined by a differentia.

### Differentia (διαφορά / diaphora)
What distinguishes one species from another within the same genus.

Example: What makes a "CLI Tool" different from a "Web Application"? The interface modality.

### Part/Whole (μέρος / meros)
The relation between a component and its containing structure.

- **Mereological**: Physical parts (chapter is part of book)
- **Functional**: Role parts (authentication is part of application)
- **Temporal**: Phase parts (development is part of project lifecycle)

## Modes of Being

### Actuality (ἐνέργεια / energeia)
What a thing currently is, fully realized.

In knowledge systems: **Current state**—the project as it exists now.

### Potentiality (δύναμις / dynamis)
What a thing could become, capacity not yet realized.

In knowledge systems: **Roadmaps, possibilities, unrealized connections**.

### Becoming (γένεσις / genesis)
The process of moving from potentiality to actuality.

In knowledge systems: **Changelogs, evolution, learning trajectories**.

---

## Causal Relations

### Material Cause
What something is made of.

In knowledge systems: **Components, dependencies, building blocks**.

### Formal Cause
The pattern or structure that makes it what it is.

In knowledge systems: **Architecture, schema, design patterns**.

### Efficient Cause
What brought it into being, the agent of change.

In knowledge systems: **Creator, author, generator, triggering event**.

### Final Cause (τέλος / telos)
The purpose or end toward which it exists.

In knowledge systems: **Goals, intended outcomes, the "why"**.

---

## Unity and Plurality

### One (τὸ ἕν / to hen)
That which is undivided, a unity.

In knowledge systems: **Atomic notes, single-concept entries**.

### Many (τὰ πολλά / ta polla)
Plurality, multiplicity.

In knowledge systems: **Collections, indices, aggregate views**.

### Same (ταὐτόν / tauton)
Identity relation—A is the same as B.

In knowledge systems: **Aliases, redirects, merged concepts**.

### Other (ἕτερον / heteron)
Difference relation—A is not B.

In knowledge systems: **Distinctions, disambiguations, contrasts**.

---

## Knowledge Relations

### A Priori
Known independently of experience.

In knowledge systems: **Definitions, logical relations, structural necessities**.

### A Posteriori
Known through experience.

In knowledge systems: **Observations, learned patterns, empirical notes**.

### Analytic
True by virtue of meaning (the predicate is contained in the subject).

In knowledge systems: **Definitional truths, tautological relations**.

### Synthetic
True by virtue of how the world is (adds new information).

In knowledge systems: **Discovered connections, emergent patterns**.

---

## Practical Applications

### Defining an Entity

Ask:
1. **What is it?** (genus)
2. **What distinguishes it?** (differentia)
3. **What is essential vs. accidental?** (essence vs. accident)
4. **What caused it?** (four causes)
5. **What is it becoming?** (potentiality)

### Organizing a Domain

1. Identify **substances** (primary things)
2. Map **relations** between them
3. Distinguish **essential** from **accidental** properties
4. Track **becoming** (change over time)
5. Note **teleology** (purposes, goals)

### Linking Knowledge

Ask:
1. Is this a **part** of something larger?
2. Is this a **species** of a broader genus?
3. Does this **depend on** something else?
4. Does this **contradict** something else?
5. Does this **exemplify** a pattern?

## Common Mistakes

### Category Errors
Treating something as belonging to a category it doesn't.

Example: Treating a process as a substance, then wondering why it doesn't have stable properties.

### Misplaced Concreteness
Treating an abstraction as if it were concrete.

Example: Treating "project velocity" as a thing rather than a derived measure.

### False Dichotomies
Treating a spectrum as a binary.

Example: "Complete or incomplete" when reality is a gradient.

### Nominalism Trap
Treating names as arbitrary, losing essential distinctions.

Example: Renaming "dependencies" to "links" and losing the asymmetric, causal meaning.
