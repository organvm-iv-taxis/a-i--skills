# Reality TV Narrative Analyzer

Framework for rigorous analysis of reality television narrative construction.

## Core Analytical Premise

Reality TV is **constructed**, not captured. Analysis should examine:
- What producers *choose* to show
- How editing *shapes* meaning
- Which narratives *serve* the format
- How "reality" is *performed* for cameras

## Genre Categories

### Competition Formats

| Format | Structure | Key Tension |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Elimination | Weekly votes/cuts | Survival pressure |
| Talent | Performance judging | Skill vs. personality |
| Dating | Rose ceremonies/couples | Romantic stakes |
| Adventure | Physical challenges | Endurance/teamwork |
| Makeover | Transformation arc | Before/after reveal |

### Documentary-Style

| Format | Focus | Narrative Engine |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Docusoap | Ensemble cast daily life | Interpersonal conflict |
| Follow-doc | Single subject/family | Personal journey |
| Workplace | Professional environment | Drama + competence |
| Real crime | Investigation/justice | Mystery resolution |

## Narrative Structure Analysis

### Episode Structure

Standard competition episode:

```
1. COLD OPEN (1-2 min)
   - Dramatic moment from later in episode
   - Hook viewer attention

2. RECAP (1-2 min)
   - Previous episode highlights
   - Set up ongoing storylines

3. ACT 1: Setup (10-15 min)
   - Challenge introduction
   - Strategy discussions (confessionals)
   - Alliance/conflict development

4. ACT 2: Competition (15-20 min)
   - Challenge execution
   - Reaction shots, confessional commentary
   - Winner/loser determination

5. ACT 3: Aftermath (10-15 min)
   - Post-challenge strategy
   - Target selection
   - Relationship dynamics

6. ACT 4: Climax (10-15 min)
   - Tribal council/elimination ceremony
   - Tension building
   - Revelation and exit

7. NEXT TIME (30 sec)
   - Tease future conflict
```

### Season Arc

```
Episodes 1-3: ESTABLISHMENT
- Introduce cast (hero, villain, underdog archetypes)
- Establish alliances and conflicts
- Set up season-long storylines

Episodes 4-7: DEVELOPMENT
- Deepen character complexity
- Shift alliances
- Build toward mid-season climax

Episodes 8-10: TURNING POINT
- Major blindside or upset
- New power dynamics
- Reset for endgame

Episodes 11-13: ENDGAME
- Final alliances solidify
- Underdog vs. frontrunner tension
- Elimination of major characters

Finale: RESOLUTION
- Final challenge/vote
- Winner crowned
- Reunion/reflection
```

## Character Archetype Analysis

### Standard Archetypes

| Archetype | Characteristics | Narrative Function |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Hero | Likeable, competent, moral | Audience identification |
| Villain | Strategic, ruthless, entertaining | Create conflict |
| Underdog | Overlooked, struggles, growth | Root-for narrative |
| Showmance | Romantic pairing | Emotional investment |
| Wildcard | Unpredictable, chaotic | Disrupt dynamics |
| Mentor | Experienced, guiding | Wisdom/tragedy |
| Comic Relief | Entertaining, harmless | Lighten tension |

### Archetype Identification Checklist

- [ ] Who gets the most confessional time?
- [ ] Who is shown in heroic vs. unflattering edits?
- [ ] Who receives sympathetic backstory?
- [ ] Who is positioned as obstacle vs. ally?
- [ ] Who gets "redemption" moments?

## Editing Analysis

### Confessional Functions

| Type | Purpose | Signals |
|------|---------|---------|
| Strategy | Explain gameplay | "My plan is..." |
| Reaction | Emotional response | Eye rolls, laughter |
| Foreshadowing | Hint at outcome | Ominous statements |
| Character | Define personality | Backstory, values |
| Narrator | Guide viewer | Explain events |

### Editing Techniques

**Frankenbiting**: Splicing audio from different contexts to create new meaning.
- Listen for audio/video sync issues
- Notice sentence fragments combined
- Compare live footage to confessional audio

**Reaction Shot Manipulation**: Placing reactions out of context.
- Same outfit in reaction = same day ≠ same conversation
- Generic reactions (laugh, eyeroll) can be placed anywhere

**Selective Emphasis**: Choosing which moments to highlight.
- Count confessional distribution
- Note who speaks before/after key events
- Track screen time per contestant

**Music/Sound Design**: Creating emotional tone.
- Ominous music = villain edit
- Uplifting music = hero moment
- Comedic sound effects = not to be taken seriously

## Analytical Frameworks

### The Story Producer's Questions

1. Who is the protagonist this episode?
2. What obstacle do they face?
3. How are they changed by end of episode?
4. What question carries to next episode?

### Power Dynamic Mapping

Track alliances across episodes:
```
Episode 1: A-B-C vs D-E-F, G floating
Episode 2: A-B vs C-D-E, F-G aligned
Episode 3: ...
```

### Edit Trajectory Analysis

Track contestant edit quality across season:
```
Contestant A: + + + 0 - - - [eliminated]
              (positive → negative = villain arc)
              
Contestant B: 0 0 0 + + + + [winner]
              (invisible → positive = winner edit)
```
