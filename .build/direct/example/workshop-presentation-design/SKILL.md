# Workshop & Presentation Design

Teach effectively through structured experiences.

## Format Selection

| Format | Duration | Audience Size | Interaction |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Lightning talk | 5-10 min | Any | Low |
| Conference talk | 20-45 min | Large | Low-Medium |
| Workshop | 1-4 hours | 10-30 | High |
| Tutorial | 2-8 hours | 5-20 | Very High |
| Course | Multi-day | Varies | Structured |

## Talk Design

### The Arc

```
Hook → Context → Core Content → Transformation → Call to Action

  │        │           │              │              │
  └────────┴───────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
                    One Clear Idea
```

### Talk Structure Template

```
0-5%    HOOK
        - Surprising fact, question, or story
        - Why should they care?

5-15%   CONTEXT
        - Background needed to understand
        - Where this fits in larger picture

15-85%  CORE CONTENT
        - 3-5 key points (rule of three)
        - Examples and evidence for each
        - Build logically

85-95%  TRANSFORMATION
        - What changes with this knowledge?
        - The "so what?"

95-100% CALL TO ACTION
        - What should they do next?
        - Memorable closing
```

### The Rule of Three

People remember three things. Structure around:
- Three main points
- Three examples
- Three takeaways

### Slide Design

**Principles**:
- One idea per slide
- Minimal text (6 words or less ideal)
- Large, legible fonts (24pt minimum)
- High contrast
- Images > text when possible

**Avoid**:
- Bullet point walls
- Reading slides aloud
- Clip art
- Busy backgrounds
- Tiny text "you probably can't see this but..."

## Workshop Design

### Learning Objectives

Write objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy verbs:

| Level | Verbs | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Remember | List, define, recall | "List the 5 principles of..." |
| Understand | Explain, describe, summarize | "Explain how X affects Y" |
| Apply | Use, implement, solve | "Apply the framework to..." |
| Analyze | Compare, contrast, examine | "Analyze the trade-offs..." |
| Evaluate | Judge, critique, assess | "Evaluate which approach..." |
| Create | Design, build, produce | "Create a working prototype..." |

### Workshop Arc

```
OPEN (10-15%)
├── Welcome, housekeeping
├── Learning objectives
├── Icebreaker/activation
└── Baseline assessment

EXPLORE (30-40%)
├── Core concept introduction
├── Demonstration
├── Guided practice
└── Check for understanding

PRACTICE (30-40%)
├── Independent/group work
├── Real-world application
├── Troubleshooting
└── Peer feedback

CLOSE (10-15%)
├── Debrief and discussion
├── Key takeaways
├── Resources for continued learning
└── Feedback collection
```

### Time Allocation

| Activity Type | Attention Span | Max Duration |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Lecture | Low | 10-15 min |
| Discussion | Medium | 15-20 min |
| Hands-on | High | 30-45 min |
| Group work | Medium-High | 20-30 min |

**Rule**: Change modality every 15-20 minutes.

### Activity Types

| Activity | Purpose | Group Size |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Think-Pair-Share | Low-risk participation | 2 |
| Gallery Walk | Share work, get feedback | 4-6 stations |
| Jigsaw | Divide & teach | 4-6 per group |
| Fishbowl | Model discussion | Inner: 4-6 |
| Live Coding | Demonstrate process | Any |
| Code Review | Practice critique | 2-4 |

## Facilitation Techniques

### Opening Strong

- Start on time (respect early arrivers)
- State what they'll be able to do by end
- Create psychological safety
- Activate prior knowledge

### Engagement Techniques

**Cold calling alternatives**:
- "Turn to your neighbor and discuss..."
- "Take 30 seconds to write..."
- "Show of hands..."
- "In the chat, share..."

**Energy management**:
- Movement breaks every 45-60 min
- Vary activity types
- Use music during exercises
- Energizer activities after breaks

### Handling Questions

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Off-topic | "Great question—let's parking lot that" |
| Too advanced | "Let's connect after for that deep dive" |
| You don't know | "I don't know, but I'll find out" |
| Dominating questioner | "Let's hear from someone else" |

### Managing Time

- Build in buffer (plan for 80% of time)
- Have "skip if needed" sections marked
- Have extension activities ready
- Visible timer for activities

## Virtual Presentations

### Platform Considerations

- Test platform features beforehand
- Know how to share screen, use whiteboard
- Use polls, reactions, breakout rooms
- Shorter sessions (max 90 min without break)

### Engagement Tactics

- More frequent interaction (every 3-5 min)
- Use chat actively
- Call on people by name
- Breakout rooms for discussion
- Polls for quick feedback

### Technical Setup

- Hardwired internet if possible
- Close unnecessary applications
- Second monitor for notes/chat
- Good lighting (face the window)
- Eye-level camera
- Quality microphone

---

## Evaluation & Iteration

### Immediate Feedback

```
Quick feedback form:
1. What was most valuable?
2. What was least valuable?
3. What questions remain?
4. Net Promoter Score (1-10)
```

### Post-Session Reflection

- What went well?
- What fell flat?
- What questions came up?
- What would I change?
- What resources do I need to add?

## Lightning Talk Template

```
5-Minute Talk Structure:

0:00 - 0:30  HOOK
             Surprising statement or question

0:30 - 1:00  CONTEXT
             Why this matters

1:00 - 3:30  THE ONE THING
             Your main point with evidence/example

3:30 - 4:30  IMPLICATIONS
             What changes because of this

4:30 - 5:00  CALL TO ACTION
             What they should do next
```
