# Document Skills Extension

This extension exposes the reference document skills located in `document-skills/`.

## What is included
- Each document skill directory is linked under `skills/`.
- These are reference implementations that mirror the document skills in this repo.

## Updating
If skills are added or removed, regenerate the links:

```bash
python3 scripts/refresh_skill_collections.py
```
