# Portfolio Presentation

Transform scattered work into compelling professional narrative.

## Core Principle

A portfolio isn't a list of projects—it's a story about who you are and what you can do for the person viewing it.

## Audience Analysis

Before curating, identify the viewer:

| Audience | Primary Interest | Time Available | Decision Criteria |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Hiring Manager | Can you do the job? | 30-90 seconds initial | Relevant skills, growth |
| Technical Lead | How do you think? | 2-5 minutes deep dive | Problem-solving, code quality |
| Client | Can you solve my problem? | 1-2 minutes | Similar work, results |
| Collaborator | Would I enjoy working with you? | Variable | Process, communication |
| Academic | What's your contribution? | Thorough review | Rigor, originality |

## Portfolio Structure

### Homepage/Landing

```
[Hero: Your positioning statement]
[Featured Work: 3-4 best pieces]
[Brief About]
[Contact/CTA]
```

**Positioning Statement Formula**:
```
I'm a [role] who [unique approach/specialty].
I help [audience] achieve [outcome] through [method].
```

### Project Selection

**The 3-5-7 Rule**:
- 3 projects minimum (shows range)
- 5 projects optimal (depth + breadth)
- 7 projects maximum (avoid overwhelm)

**Selection Criteria**:
| Criterion | Weight | Question |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Relevance | 30% | Does it match target opportunity? |
| Impact | 25% | Can I quantify results? |
| Craft | 20% | Does it showcase my best work? |
| Recency | 15% | Is it current enough? |
| Story | 10% | Is there a compelling narrative? |

### Project Order

1. **Lead with best fit** (not necessarily best work)
2. **Second strongest** (captures attention)
3. **Show range** (different type/scale)
4. **Personal/passion project** (shows personality)
5. **Stretch piece** (aspirational direction)

## Case Study Framework

### Quick Format (Portfolio Card)

```markdown
## [Project Name]

**Role**: [Your specific role]
**Timeline**: [Duration]
**Team**: [Size/composition]

[One compelling image]

[2-3 sentence summary: Problem → Solution → Result]

**Key Outcome**: [Single quantified result]
```

### Standard Format (Project Page)

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Overview
[Elevator pitch: What is it? Who's it for? Why does it matter?]

## The Challenge
[Problem statement with context and stakes]

## My Role
[Specific responsibilities and contributions]

## Process
[Key phases with visuals]
1. Discovery/Research
2. Ideation/Strategy
3. Execution/Implementation
4. Iteration/Refinement

## Solution
[What was built/created with visuals]

## Results
[Quantified outcomes]
- [Metric]: [Before] → [After]
- [Metric]: [Improvement]

## Reflection
[What I learned, what I'd do differently]
```

## Narrative Patterns

### The Transformation Arc

```
Status Quo → Disruption → Struggle → Insight → Resolution → New Normal
```

### The Problem-Solution-Impact

```
[User] was struggling with [problem]
We discovered [insight]
So we built [solution]
Which resulted in [impact]
```

### The Process Story

```
We started by [research/discovery]
Which revealed [key insight]
Leading us to [design decision]
Through [iteration], we arrived at [solution]
```

### The Constraint Story

```
Given [constraints: time/budget/tech]
We had to [creative approach]
Which taught us [lesson]
And delivered [outcome despite constraints]
```

## Visual Presentation

### Image Requirements

| Type | Purpose | Specs |
|------|---------|-------|
| Hero | First impression | 16:9 or 4:3, high-res |
| Process | Show thinking | Annotated, clear |
| Detail | Craft quality | Cropped, focused |
| Before/After | Show impact | Side-by-side |
| Context | Real-world use | In-situ photos |

### Screenshot Best Practices

- Show real data (anonymized if needed)
- Browser chrome optional (clean vs. context)
- Highlight key interactions
- Include mobile views if responsive
- Show states: empty, loading, populated, error

### Video/Animation

When to use:
- Complex interactions
- Time-based experiences
- Before/after transformations
- Process documentation

Keep under 60 seconds for portfolio context.

✅ "Increasing Conversion 40% Through Checkout Simplification"

### Descriptions

❌ "I designed the UI and implemented the frontend"
✅ "Led design and development of checkout flow that reduced cart abandonment from 68% to 41%"

### Quantification

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Improved performance | Reduced load time from 4.2s to 0.8s |
| Increased engagement | Grew DAU 3x over 6 months |
| Better user experience | NPS improved from 32 to 67 |

### Voice

- First person for personal sites ("I designed...")
- First person plural for team work ("We discovered...")
- Active voice always
- Present tense for live work, past for completed
