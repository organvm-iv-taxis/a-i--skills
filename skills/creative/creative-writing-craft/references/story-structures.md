# Alternative Story Structures

Beyond three-act structure: frameworks for different narrative needs.

## Kishōtenketsu (Four-Act)

Japanese/Chinese/Korean structure without central conflict.

```
Ki (Introduction)  → Establish characters, setting
Shō (Development)  → Deepen without conflict
Ten (Twist)        → Surprising element, new perspective
Ketsu (Conclusion) → Reconcile, new understanding
```

**When to use**: Slice-of-life, contemplative fiction, character studies

**Example**: A woman tends her garden (Ki), remembers her mother teaching her (Shō), discovers a note her mother hid years ago (Ten), understands her mother's sacrifices (Ketsu).

## Freytag's Pyramid (Five-Act)

Classical dramatic structure from Greek tragedy.

```
        Climax
          /\
         /  \
   Rising    Falling
   Action    Action
       /      \
      /        \
Exposition    Resolution
              (Dénouement)
```

**When to use**: Traditional drama, tragedy, literary fiction

## The Hero's Journey (Monomyth)

Joseph Campbell's 12-stage mythic structure.

```
ORDINARY WORLD
    ↓
CALL TO ADVENTURE
    ↓
REFUSAL OF THE CALL
    ↓
MEETING THE MENTOR
    ↓
CROSSING THE THRESHOLD
    ↓
TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES
    ↓
APPROACH TO INMOST CAVE
    ↓
ORDEAL
    ↓
REWARD
    ↓
THE ROAD BACK
    ↓
RESURRECTION
    ↓
RETURN WITH ELIXIR
```

**When to use**: Epic adventure, fantasy, transformation stories

## The Virgin's Promise

Kim Hudson's alternative to Hero's Journey, focused on self-fulfillment.

```
DEPENDENT WORLD → SECRET WORLD → CLAIMING GIFTS →
SHOWING TALENT → NO LONGER FITS → CAUGHT SHINING →
GIVES UP WHAT KEPT HER STUCK → KINGDOM IN CHAOS →
WANDERS IN WILDERNESS → CHOOSES AUTHENTIC SELF →
RE-ORDERING → KINGDOM BRIGHT
```

**When to use**: Coming-of-age, self-discovery, artistic journeys

## Seven-Point Story Structure

Dan Wells' simplified plot architecture.

```
1. Hook        → Start in opposite state from Resolution
2. Plot Turn 1 → Call to action, world changes
3. Pinch 1     → Apply pressure, introduce villain
4. Midpoint    → Move from reaction to action
5. Pinch 2     → Apply more pressure, dark moment
6. Plot Turn 2 → Final piece of puzzle, power obtained
7. Resolution  → Achieve/fail the goal
```

**When to use**: Genre fiction, plotting quickly, clear structure

## Fichtean Curve

Begin with rising action, no flat exposition.

```
     Crisis
        /\
       /  \
Crises     Resolution
     /
Rising Action (starts immediately)
```

**When to use**: Thrillers, action stories, in medias res openings

## In Medias Res with Flashback

Start in the middle, fill in backstory.

```
PRESENT (Crisis) → PAST (Setup) → PRESENT (Development) →
PAST (Key Event) → PRESENT (Climax) → RESOLUTION
```

**When to use**: Mystery, complex timelines, when backstory is crucial

## Frame Narrative

Story within a story.

```
Outer Frame: Character tells story
    Inner Story: The main narrative
Outer Frame: Returns to present, reflects
```

**When to use**: Adding perspective, unreliable narration, thematic commentary

## Circular/Bookend Structure

End where you began, transformed.

```
Opening Image → Story Events → Closing Image (mirrors opening)
```

**Key**: The return reveals how character/situation has changed.

**When to use**: Literary fiction, transformation arcs, poetic resonance

## Episodic Structure

Loosely connected episodes, same characters.

```
Episode 1: Complete mini-arc
Episode 2: Different situation, same character
Episode 3: Another situation
Finale: Threads connect
```

**When to use**: Picaresque, slice-of-life, character-driven collections

## Non-Linear Structures

### Reverse Chronology

```
End → Middle events → Beginning
```
**Example**: *Memento*, revealing "why" at the end

### Parallel Timelines

```
Past A → Present A → Past B → Present B → Convergence
```
**Example**: Two timelines that illuminate each other

### Mosaic/Fragmented

```
[Fragment] [Fragment] [Fragment] → Reader assembles meaning
```
**Example**: *Cloud Atlas*, interconnected stories
