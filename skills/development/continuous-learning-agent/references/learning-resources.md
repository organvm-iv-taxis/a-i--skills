## Learning Strategies

### The Feynman Technique

1. **Study** the concept
2. **Teach** it in simple terms
3. **Identify** gaps in understanding
4. **Review** and simplify

### Spaced Repetition

- Use Anki for memorization
- Review at increasing intervals
- Focus on concepts, not syntax

### Project-Based Learning

1. **Choose** a project slightly beyond current skills
2. **Plan** what you need to learn
3. **Build** incrementally
4. **Reflect** on what you learned

### Learning in Public

- Write blog posts explaining concepts
- Share progress on Twitter/Mastodon
- Contribute to open source
- Answer questions on Stack Overflow
