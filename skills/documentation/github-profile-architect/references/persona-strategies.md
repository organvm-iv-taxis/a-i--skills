## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Fruit Salad
Too many badges in clashing colors. Stick to your actual stack, use consistent styling.

### The Ghost Profile
Empty profile or only a photo. Even a minimal profile is better than nothing.

### The Braggart
"10x developer, ninja, rockstar." Let your work demonstrate skill.

### The Time Capsule
Last update 2 years ago. Dead profiles hurt more than help.

### The Kitchen Sink
Every technology ever touched. Focus on what you actually use and know.

### The Copy-Paste
Obvious template with no personalization. Make it yours.
