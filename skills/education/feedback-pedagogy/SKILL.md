# Feedback Pedagogy

Transform feedback from judgment to learning opportunity.

## Feedback Philosophy

### Feedback vs Evaluation

| Evaluation | Feedback |
|------------|----------|
| Judges quality | Improves quality |
| Backward-looking | Forward-looking |
| "This is wrong" | "Here's how to improve" |
| Grade | Growth |

### Effective Feedback Is...

- **Specific**: Points to exact moments, not vague impressions
- **Actionable**: Gives clear next steps
- **Timely**: Close enough to remember context
- **Balanced**: Acknowledges strengths and growth areas
- **Goal-referenced**: Tied to learning objectives

---

## Written Feedback Framework

### The Feedback Sandwich (Use Sparingly)

```
Strength → Growth Area → Encouragement
```

Better: **Targeted feedback** that addresses what matters most.

### The 3-2-1 Model

```
3 things done well (specific examples)
2 areas for development (with suggestions)
1 question to consider (promotes reflection)
```

### Feedback Comment Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Praise** | Reinforce effective choices | "Your thesis clearly states your argument and previews your main points" |
| **Explanation** | Clarify why something matters | "Topic sentences help readers follow your logic" |
| **Suggestion** | Offer concrete improvement | "Try adding a transition here to connect these ideas" |
| **Question** | Prompt deeper thinking | "What evidence would strengthen this claim?" |
| **Reader response** | Share authentic reaction | "I got lost here—what's the main point?" |

### Prioritization

Don't mark everything. Focus on:

1. **Higher-order concerns first**
   - Thesis/argument
   - Organization/structure
   - Evidence/support
   - Analysis/development

2. **Then lower-order concerns**
   - Sentence clarity
   - Word choice
   - Grammar/mechanics
   - Formatting

### Comment Placement

| Location | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| Marginal | Specific, local issues |
| End note | Big-picture patterns, priorities |
| Rubric | Systematic criteria assessment |

## Rubric Design

### Rubric Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Holistic** | Single score, overall quality | Quick assessment, writing portfolios |
| **Analytic** | Separate scores per criterion | Detailed feedback, skill isolation |
| **Single-point** | Criteria list, no levels | Flexibility, avoiding "teaching to rubric" |

### Analytic Rubric Template

```markdown
## [Assignment Name] Rubric

| Criterion | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Thesis | Clear, arguable, specific thesis that addresses prompt | Thesis present and mostly clear | Thesis unclear or too broad | No identifiable thesis |
| Evidence | Multiple relevant, well-integrated sources | Adequate evidence with some integration issues | Limited or poorly integrated evidence | Little to no evidence |
| Analysis | Sophisticated analysis connecting evidence to argument | Analysis present but could be deeper | Summary more than analysis | Minimal analysis |
| Organization | Clear structure with effective transitions | Mostly organized with some rough transitions | Disorganized or hard to follow | No discernible structure |
| Mechanics | Nearly error-free | Few errors that don't impede meaning | Errors sometimes impede meaning | Errors significantly impede meaning |

**Total: ___/20**
```

### Single-Point Rubric Template

```markdown
## [Assignment Name] Single-Point Rubric

| Areas for Growth | Criterion (Proficient) | Areas of Strength |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| [Space for feedback] | Clear thesis that takes a position | [Space for feedback] |
| [Space for feedback] | Evidence supports all major claims | [Space for feedback] |
| [Space for feedback] | Analysis explains how evidence proves thesis | [Space for feedback] |
| [Space for feedback] | Logical organization with transitions | [Space for feedback] |
| [Space for feedback] | Appropriate academic style | [Space for feedback] |
```

### Rubric Design Principles

- Align criteria with learning objectives
- Use observable, measurable language
- Avoid vague terms ("good," "adequate")
- Include descriptors at each level
- Share rubric with students BEFORE assignment

## Peer Review Facilitation

### Preparing Students

1. Model feedback using examples
2. Practice on anonymous samples
3. Provide structured protocols
4. Establish community norms

### Peer Review Protocol

```markdown
## Peer Review Guide

**Reader**: [Name]
**Writer**: [Name]

### First Read (Big Picture)
Read the whole piece without stopping. Note your overall impression.

- What is the main argument?
- What worked well?
- What confused you?

### Second Read (Detailed)
Answer these questions with specific examples:

1. **Thesis**: Can you identify the thesis? Is it arguable?
2. **Structure**: Does the organization make sense? Where did you get lost?
3. **Evidence**: Which evidence is most convincing? Where do you need more?
4. **Analysis**: Where could the writer dig deeper?

### Feedback Summary
- One thing that's working well:
- One thing to prioritize in revision:
- One question for the writer:
```

### Peer Review Norms

**Readers should**:
- Be specific (cite examples)
- Ask questions
- Suggest, don't command
- Focus on the writing, not the writer

**Writers should**:
- Listen without defending
- Ask clarifying questions
- Take notes
- Decide what feedback to use

## Verbal Feedback (Conferences)

### Conference Structure

```
1. Open: "What do you want me to focus on?"
2. Listen: Let student identify concerns
3. Prioritize: "Let's focus on X because..."
4. Demonstrate: Model revision strategy
5. Apply: Have student try it
6. Close: "What's your next step?"
```

### Questioning Techniques

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "This is unclear" | "What do you mean here?" |
| "Add more detail" | "What else could you tell me about this?" |
| "This doesn't make sense" | "Walk me through your thinking here" |
| "You need a thesis" | "What's the main point you want readers to take away?" |

## Efficiency Strategies

### For Large Classes

- Use rubrics consistently
- Create comment banks for common issues
- Audio/video feedback (often faster than writing)
- Peer review for formative feedback
- Focus grading on selected criteria
- Grade samples, not everything

### Comment Bank Examples

```
THESIS ISSUES:
- "Your thesis tells me what the paper is about but doesn't take a position. 
   Try: 'Although X, Y because Z.'"
- "This thesis is too broad. Can you narrow to a specific aspect?"

EVIDENCE ISSUES:
- "Good evidence, but I need your analysis. What does this quote prove?"
- "This claim needs support. What source could back this up?"

ORGANIZATION:
- "Nice paragraph, but it might fit better after [section]. See what you think."
- "I need a transition here to understand how we got from A to B."
```

### Audio/Video Feedback

Benefits:
- Faster than writing (often 2-3x)
- Conveys tone better
- Feels more personal
- Can screencast while scrolling

Tips:
- Keep under 5 minutes
- Start with overview, then specifics
- Reference specific locations
- End with priorities

## Growth Mindset Language

| Fixed Mindset | Growth Mindset |
|---------------|----------------|
| "You're not good at this" | "This skill takes practice" |
| "This is wrong" | "This doesn't quite work yet" |
| "You don't understand" | "Let's work on understanding" |
| "Smart students get this" | "This is challenging for everyone" |
