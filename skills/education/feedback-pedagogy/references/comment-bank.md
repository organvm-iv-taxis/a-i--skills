## Thesis & Argument

### Praise
- "Your thesis clearly states your position and previews your main points—this gives readers a clear roadmap."
- "Strong, arguable claim. I can see exactly what you'll be proving."
- "Nice job taking a specific stance rather than staying neutral."

### Constructive
- "I can see your topic, but what's your position on it? Try: 'Although X, Y because Z.'"
- "This thesis is quite broad. Can you narrow to a specific aspect or time period?"
- "Your thesis tells me what the paper is about but not what you're arguing. What do you want to prove?"
- "Consider whether someone could disagree with this claim. If not, it might need sharpening."

### Questions
- "What's the main point you want readers to take away?"
- "If you had to summarize your argument in one sentence, what would it be?"
- "What would someone who disagrees with you say?"

---

## Evidence & Support

### Praise
- "Excellent choice of evidence here—this quote directly supports your point."
- "Good variety of sources. The mix of expert opinion and data strengthens your argument."
- "Smart use of a specific example to illustrate the broader concept."

### Constructive
- "Strong claim—what evidence could back this up?"
- "Good quote, but I need your analysis. What does this prove? How does it connect to your thesis?"
- "This section makes several claims. Pick the most important and develop it with specific evidence."
- "You've summarized the source well, but what's YOUR analysis of it?"
- "Consider: is this the strongest evidence for this point, or is there something more compelling?"

### Questions
- "What source could support this claim?"
- "How does this evidence connect to your thesis?"
- "What would someone skeptical of this evidence say? How would you respond?"

---

## Organization & Structure

### Praise
- "Clear topic sentence—I immediately know what this paragraph will argue."
- "Nice transition here. I can follow your logic from one point to the next."
- "Effective structure. Each paragraph builds on the previous one."

### Constructive
- "This paragraph covers several ideas. Consider splitting it, with one main point per paragraph."
- "I got lost between these two sections. What's the connection?"
- "Strong paragraph, but it might fit better after [section] to build your argument more logically."
- "Your topic sentence doesn't quite match what the paragraph argues. Revise one or the other."
- "Consider: what's the logical order for these points? Does each one lead to the next?"

### Questions
- "What's the one main idea of this paragraph?"
- "Why does this point come here rather than earlier/later?"
- "How does this paragraph advance your overall argument?"

---

## Analysis & Depth

### Praise
- "Insightful analysis. You've gone beyond summary to explain significance."
- "I appreciate how you connected this to the broader implications."
- "Good job explaining not just what the author says, but why it matters for your argument."

### Constructive
- "You've described what happens, but why does it matter? Push your analysis deeper."
- "This reads as summary. What's YOUR interpretation?"
- "Interesting observation. Now: so what? What are the implications?"
- "You're on to something here. Develop this idea further—it's the most interesting part of the paper."
- "Don't stop at the surface. What underlying assumptions or patterns do you see?"

### Questions
- "So what? Why does this matter?"
- "What does this reveal about the larger issue?"
- "What would change if this weren't true?"

---

## Clarity & Style

### Praise
- "Clear, direct prose. Easy to follow your thinking."
- "Good variety in sentence structure—keeps the reader engaged."
- "Effective word choice here. 'X' captures exactly what you mean."

### Constructive
- "This sentence is trying to do too much. Try breaking it into two."
- "I had to read this paragraph twice. Can you simplify the phrasing?"
- "Watch for passive voice. Who is doing this action?"
- "Several sentences start the same way. Vary your openings for better flow."
- "'Very' and 'really' weaken your prose. Find stronger, more specific words."

### Questions
- "What's the simplest way to say this?"
- "Is every word in this sentence necessary?"
- "Who is your audience? Would they understand this term?"

---

## Introductions & Conclusions

### Praise
- "Engaging opening. You've captured my interest and set up the stakes."
- "Your conclusion goes beyond summary to show why this matters—nicely done."
- "Good use of a hook that connects to your argument."

### Constructive
- "Your intro jumps into argument too quickly. Help the reader understand the context first."
- "Avoid starting with dictionary definitions or broad generalizations. What's YOUR angle?"
- "Your conclusion mostly repeats the introduction. What new insight can you leave the reader with?"
- "Consider ending with implications or a call to action rather than just restating your thesis."
- "The stakes aren't clear. Why should readers care about this topic?"

### Questions
- "What background does your reader need before diving into your argument?"
- "What's the one thing you want readers to remember?"
- "If your argument is correct, what follows? What should happen next?"

---

## Grammar & Mechanics

### Praise
- "Clean, error-free prose. Your careful editing shows."
- "Consistent citation formatting throughout."

### Constructive
- "Watch your comma splices. These two independent clauses need a period or semicolon."
- "Subject-verb agreement issue here. 'The group of students' is singular."
- "Proofread for typos—I spotted a few that spell-check might miss."
- "Citation needed here. Even paraphrased ideas need attribution."
- "Check your apostrophes: 'its' (possessive) vs. 'it's' (it is)."

### Pattern Notes
- "I'm seeing the same issue in several places: [X]. Focus your editing on this pattern."
- "Most mechanical errors are [type]. Review the rule and check throughout."
