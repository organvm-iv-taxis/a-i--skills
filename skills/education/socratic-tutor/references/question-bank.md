## Probing Implications & Consequences

## Questions About the Question

Use to foster metacognition and self-direction.

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "Why do you think I asked that?" | Building metacognition |
| "What's the real question here?" | Surface question masks deeper one |
| "What would you need to know to answer this?" | Identifying knowledge gaps |
| "Is this the right question to be asking?" | Reframing needed |
| "What question would help you most right now?" | Developing self-direction |
| "How is this question different from [previous one]?" | Building connections |

---

## Debugging & Problem-Solving Questions

Especially useful for technical/coding contexts.

### Understanding the Problem

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "What exactly is happening vs. what should happen?" | Unclear problem statement |
| "What did you expect to see?" | Need to surface expectations |
| "At what point does it stop working?" | Need to localize issue |
| "What was the last thing you changed?" | Debugging strategy |
| "Can you reproduce this consistently?" | Intermittent issues |

### Tracing Logic

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "Walk me through what this code does line by line." | Lost in complexity |
| "What's the value of X at this point?" | Need to trace state |
| "When does this condition become true?" | Control flow confusion |
| "What happens if this input is empty/null/zero?" | Edge cases |
| "Why did you choose this approach?" | Understanding intent |

### Guiding to Solutions

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "What have you tried so far?" | Starting point |
| "What does the error message tell you?" | Ignoring feedback |
| "Where in the code does that happen?" | Need to localize |
| "What's different between the working case and broken case?" | Comparison needed |
| "What would you Google to find help?" | Building research skills |

---

## Conceptual Understanding Questions

For building deep comprehension.

### Making Connections

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "How does this relate to [previous topic]?" | Isolated learning |
| "What pattern do you see here?" | Surface-level observation |
| "Have you seen something like this before?" | Building on prior knowledge |
| "What's the underlying principle?" | Stuck on specifics |
| "Is this similar to or different from [X]?" | Building mental models |

### Testing Understanding

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "Can you teach this back to me?" | Verifying comprehension |
| "What would be a good test question for this?" | Metacognition |
| "If I changed [variable], what would happen?" | Deep vs. surface learning |
| "Why does this work this way and not another way?" | Rote memorization |
| "What's the simplest version of this concept?" | Complexity overwhelming |

## Scaffolding Questions (When Stuck)

Use progressively when learner is blocked.

### Level 1: Orienting (Gentle)
- "What do you know for sure about this?"
- "What's the first thing you'd try?"
- "What tools/resources might help here?"

### Level 2: Narrowing (More Directed)
- "The issue is in [section]. What do you notice there?"
- "Look at line [X]. What's happening with [variable]?"
- "Compare these two things. What's different?"

### Level 3: Hinting (Direct Support)
- "This is related to [concept]. Ring any bells?"
- "The problem involves [type of issue]. Does that help?"
- "Think about what happens when [condition]..."

### Level 4: Modeling (Last Resort)
- "Let me show you one approach, then you try a similar one..."
- "Here's how I'd think about this: [think aloud]..."

## Response Patterns

### When the learner is correct
- "Good. Now, why does that work?"
- "Yes. Can you think of another example?"
- "Right. What would happen if we changed [X]?"

### When the learner is partially correct
- "You're on the right track. What about [missing piece]?"
- "That's part of it. What else might be involved?"
- "Close. What happens in [edge case]?"

### When the learner is incorrect
- "Interesting. Walk me through your reasoning."
- "Let's test that. What would we expect to see if that were true?"
- "What if we tried [counterexample]? Would your answer still hold?"

### When the learner says "I don't know"
- "That's okay. What DO you know about this?"
- "Where would you start looking?"
- "What would help you figure it out?"
- "Let's break it down. What's the first piece?"
