# Content Distribution

Get your work seen without becoming a full-time marketer.

## Distribution Philosophy

### The Reality

- Great work doesn't promote itself
- You don't need millions of followers
- Consistency beats virality
- Value attracts audience

### The Sustainable Approach

| Unsustainable | Sustainable |
|---------------|-------------|
| Post daily everywhere | Focus on 1-2 platforms |
| Chase trends | Build on your expertise |
| Optimize for algorithm | Optimize for humans |
| Content for content's sake | Share genuine value |

---

## Platform Selection

### Choose Based On

1. **Where is your audience?**
2. **What format fits your work?**
3. **What can you sustain?**

### Platform Strengths

| Platform | Best For | Content Type | Effort |
|----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Twitter/X | Tech, ideas, discussion | Short-form, threads | Medium |
| LinkedIn | Professional, B2B | Articles, updates | Medium |
| Instagram | Visual work, creative | Images, reels | High |
| YouTube | Tutorials, long-form | Video | Very High |
| TikTok | Entertainment, quick tips | Short video | High |
| Substack/Newsletter | Deep content, owned audience | Long-form writing | Medium |
| Personal Blog | SEO, portfolio | Any | Low |
| GitHub | Code, open source | Repositories | Low |

### The 70/20/10 Rule

Pick ONE primary platform:
- 70% of effort on primary platform
- 20% on secondary platform
- 10% experimenting

---

## Content Strategy

### Content Pillars

Define 3-5 themes you consistently create around:

```
Example for a creative technologist:
1. Technical tutorials (how I built X)
2. Creative process (behind the scenes)
3. Industry commentary (trends, tools)
4. Personal projects (show the work)
5. Career/professional development
```

### Content Types by Effort

| Low Effort | Medium Effort | High Effort |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Retweet + comment | Thread/carousel | Blog post |
| Quick tip | Short-form video | YouTube video |
| Question | Newsletter | Course/workshop |
| Work-in-progress | Case study | Open source project |
| Curated links | Tutorial | Research paper |

### The 4-1-1 Rule

For every 6 posts:
- 4 share value from others (curate)
- 1 soft self-promotion
- 1 direct self-promotion

Or: **Give value 5x for every 1x you ask**

## Content Creation

### The Show Your Work Framework

From Austin Kleon:

1. **Daily dispatch**: Share process, not just product
2. **Flow, not stock**: Ongoing sharing, not just launches
3. **Become a documentarian**: Capture as you go

### Content Prompts

**Process**:
- What are you working on today?
- What problem did you just solve?
- What mistake did you make?
- What did you learn this week?

**Teaching**:
- What do beginners get wrong?
- What's a shortcut you discovered?
- What tool changed your workflow?
- What concept took you too long to understand?

**Opinion**:
- What's a hot take in your field?
- What's underrated/overrated?
- What would you tell yourself 5 years ago?
- What do you disagree with experts on?

### Writing Formats That Work

**Thread/Carousel**:
```
Hook: Surprising claim or question
Point 1: [Evidence/example]
Point 2: [Evidence/example]
Point 3: [Evidence/example]
Summary: Key takeaway
CTA: Follow for more / Link to resource
```

**Short-form post**:
```
[Hook - first line matters most]

[Value - the actual content]

[CTA - what to do next]
```

## Repurposing

### The Content Pyramid

```
                    ┌───────────┐
                    │  Pillar   │  Long-form (blog, video)
                    │  Content  │
                    └─────┬─────┘
                          │
              ┌───────────┼───────────┐
              ▼           ▼           ▼
         ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
         │Thread 1│ │Thread 2│ │Thread 3│  Medium-form
         └────┬───┘ └────┬───┘ └────┬───┘
              │          │          │
         ┌────┴────┬─────┴────┬─────┴────┐
         ▼         ▼          ▼          ▼
      Tweets   Quotes    Images     Clips    Micro-content
```

### Repurposing Workflow

One blog post becomes:
- Twitter thread
- LinkedIn article
- 5-10 individual tweets/posts
- Newsletter section
- Carousel graphics
- Video script
- Podcast talking points

### Repurposing Rules

- Wait between platforms (not same day)
- Adapt format to platform norms
- Don't just copy/paste
- Update with new insights

## Engagement Strategy

### Meaningful Engagement

**Do**:
- Add value to conversations
- Ask genuine questions
- Share relevant experiences
- Credit and amplify others

**Don't**:
- Generic comments ("Great post!")
- Hijack threads for self-promo
- Engage only with big accounts
- Automate engagement

### Building Relationships

1. **Identify peers**: 20-50 people in your space
2. **Engage consistently**: Comment on their work
3. **Add value first**: Help before asking
4. **Collaborate**: Guest posts, interviews, projects

### Responding to Engagement

- Reply to comments within 24 hours
- Ask follow-up questions
- Thank people who share
- DM people who engage consistently

## Analytics That Matter

### Vanity vs Valuable Metrics

| Vanity | Valuable |
|--------|----------|
| Follower count | Follower growth rate |
| Total likes | Engagement rate |
| Impressions | Click-through rate |
| Views | Subscribers/email signups |

### What to Track

- Which content types perform best?
- When does your audience engage?
- What topics resonate?
- Where do website visitors come from?

### Review Cadence

- **Weekly**: Quick check on recent posts
- **Monthly**: Content performance review
- **Quarterly**: Strategy adjustment

---

## Sustainable Schedule

### Minimum Viable Presence

| Platform | Minimum | Ideal |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Twitter | 3x/week | 1x/day |
| LinkedIn | 2x/week | 3-4x/week |
| Newsletter | 2x/month | Weekly |
| Blog | 2x/month | Weekly |
| YouTube | 2x/month | Weekly |

### Batching

- **Write day**: Create content in batches
- **Schedule ahead**: Use scheduling tools
- **Repurpose day**: Transform existing content
- **Engagement time**: Daily 15-30 min blocks

---

## Launch Strategy

### For a New Project

**Pre-launch** (2-4 weeks before):
- Tease what's coming
- Share behind-the-scenes
- Build email list interest

**Launch week**:
- Announce on all platforms
- Ask friends to share
- Engage with every comment
- Share social proof

**Post-launch**:
- Thank supporters
- Share results/learnings
- Continue creating content
