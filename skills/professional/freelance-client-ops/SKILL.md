## Pricing

### Pricing Models

| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| **Hourly** | Uncertain scope, ongoing work | Simple, flexible | Penalizes efficiency |
| **Project-based** | Defined deliverables | Predictable for both | Scope creep risk |
| **Retainer** | Ongoing relationships | Steady income | Can feel like employment |
| **Value-based** | High-impact work | Highest potential | Harder to sell |

### Calculating Rates

```
Annual salary desired: $100,000
Billable hours (50% of time): 1,000 hours
Benefits, taxes, overhead: +30%

Hourly rate = ($100,000 × 1.3) / 1,000 = $130/hour
```

### Project Pricing Formula

```
Estimated hours × hourly rate × complexity multiplier + expenses

Complexity multiplier:
- Simple, familiar: 1.0
- Moderate complexity: 1.25
- Complex, new territory: 1.5
- Rush job: 1.5-2.0
```

### Pricing Communication

> "Based on the scope we discussed, this project would be $X. That includes [deliverables] and [rounds of revisions]. Timeline would be [X weeks]."

Don't apologize for your rates.
