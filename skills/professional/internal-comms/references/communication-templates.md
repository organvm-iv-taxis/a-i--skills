## Writing Tips for Internal Comms

### Tone Guidelines

| Situation | Tone | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Good news | Celebratory but humble | "We're excited to share..." |
| Bad news | Direct, empathetic | "We need to share some difficult news..." |
| Change | Calm, clear | "We're making some changes to..." |
| Urgent | Clear, actionable | "Action required by [date]..." |

### Formatting Best Practices

- Lead with the most important information
- Use headers and bullets for scannability
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Include clear next steps or actions
- Add dates and owners for accountability
- Link to more details rather than including everything
