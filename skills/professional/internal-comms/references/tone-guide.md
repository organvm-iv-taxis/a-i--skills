# Internal Communications Tone Guide

Principles for effective internal communications across contexts.

## Core Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "We're pivoting our go-to-market strategy" | "We're changing how we sell" |
| "Synergize cross-functional resources" | "Work together across teams" |
| "Leverage core competencies" | "Use our strengths" |

### Direct but Human

```
Too formal:
"It has come to our attention that..."

Too casual:
"Hey folks, so like..."

Just right:
"We've noticed..." or "We want to share..."
```

### Transparent Without Oversharing

**Include:**
- The what and why
- How it affects them
- What happens next
- Where to ask questions

**Omit:**
- Confidential deliberation details
- Information that creates more confusion
- Speculation or unconfirmed plans

---

## Tone by Situation

### Announcements (Good News)

**Characteristics:**
- Celebratory but grounded
- Acknowledge team effort
- Forward-looking

**Example Opening:**
> "We're thrilled to announce... This milestone reflects the hard work of [teams] over the past [period]."

**What to Avoid:**
- Excessive superlatives ("AMAZING!!!")
- Taking credit individually
- Ignoring contributors

---

### Announcements (Difficult News)

**Characteristics:**
- Direct and honest
- Empathetic but not apologetic
- Clear on impact and next steps

**Example Opening:**
> "We need to share some difficult news. [Clear statement of what's happening.] We know this is hard, and we want to be transparent about [context]."

**What to Avoid:**
- Burying the lead
- Euphemisms that obscure meaning
- Deflecting responsibility
- Empty platitudes

---

### Policy/Process Changes

**Characteristics:**
- Clear on what's changing
- Explain the "why"
- Specific on timeline
- Practical on "how"

**Example Opening:**
> "Starting [date], we're updating [policy/process]. Here's what's changing and why."

**Structure:**
1. What's changing
2. Why we're making this change
3. When it takes effect
4. What you need to do
5. Where to get help

---

### Requests for Action

**Characteristics:**
- Clear deadline
- Specific ask
- Easy to act on
- Consequence of inaction (if relevant)

**Example:**
> "Action needed by [date]: Please [specific action]. This takes about [X minutes]. If we don't hear from you by [deadline], [consequence]."

**What to Avoid:**
- Vague timeframes ("soon", "when you can")
- Multiple asks in one message
- Hiding the ask in long paragraphs

---

### Crisis Communications

**Characteristics:**
- Calm and factual
- Acknowledge uncertainty appropriately
- Provide clear guidance
- Promise and deliver updates

**Example Opening:**
> "We're aware of [situation] and are actively [responding]. Here's what we know right now and what we're doing."

**Key Elements:**
- What happened (facts only)
- What we're doing
- What you should do
- When we'll update you

## Audience Considerations

### All-Hands / Company-Wide

- Assume no prior context
- Avoid team-specific jargon
- Connect to company mission/values
- Provide links for more detail

### Leadership Updates

- Higher-level strategic framing
- Less tactical detail
- Focus on decisions and rationale
- Acknowledge trade-offs

### Team-Specific

- Can use team jargon
- More tactical detail
- Direct call-outs to individuals
- Specific action items

---

## Formatting for Readability

### Headers

```
# Main Topic (One per message)
## Major Section
### Subsection
```

### Bullet Points

**Good for:**
- Lists of 3+ items
- Action items
- Quick updates

**Keep them:**
- Parallel in structure
- Concise (one line each)
- Scannable

### Tables

**Good for:**
- Dates and deadlines
- Comparisons
- Status at a glance

### Bold

Use for:
- **Key terms** on first use
- **Deadlines** and dates
- **Action required** indicators

Don't overuse - if everything is bold, nothing is.

## Common Mistakes

### Burying the Lead

**Before:**
> "As you may know, we've been evaluating our vendor relationships over the past quarter. After extensive review of costs, capabilities, and strategic alignment, the leadership team met last week to discuss..."

**After:**
> "We're switching from [Vendor A] to [Vendor B] starting [Date]. Here's what this means for you."

### Passive Voice Overuse

**Before:**
> "It was decided that the policy would be updated."

**After:**
> "We've decided to update the policy."

### Vague Language

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "in the near future" | "by March 15" |
| "a few changes" | "three changes" |
| "some people" | "customer support team" |
| "may be affected" | "will change for [who]" |

### Missing the "So What"

Always answer:
- Why should they care?
- What do they need to do?
- What happens if they don't?
