## Example Stories

### Story #1: The Impossible Deadline

**Quick Summary:** Led team to deliver critical feature in half the expected time.

**Tags:** #leadership #achievement #pressure

**Usable for Questions About:**
- Tell me about a time you led a team
- Describe working under pressure
- How do you prioritize?
- Tell me about an accomplishment

**SITUATION**
Our company's largest enterprise client threatened to leave unless we delivered a custom integration within 3 weeks. The engineering estimate was 6-8 weeks. As the senior engineer, I was asked to find a way to make it happen.

**TASK**
I needed to scope a viable approach, assemble and lead a team, and deliver a working solution in less than half the estimated time.

**ACTION**
First, I spent a day with the client to truly understand their must-haves versus nice-to-haves. This reduced scope by 40%. Then I identified three engineers who had relevant experience and proposed we form a dedicated squad. I negotiated with their managers to free them up. I broke the work into parallel tracks and established daily syncs to catch blockers early. When we hit a technical wall on day 4, I made the call to use a third-party service instead of building custom—a trade-off I documented and got approved in a 30-minute decision meeting.

**RESULT**
We delivered the core integration in 2.5 weeks. The client not only stayed but expanded their contract by 25%. My manager nominated me for a spot bonus, and the squad approach became a template for other urgent projects. I learned that the biggest time savings often come from scope negotiation, not just working faster.

---

**Talking Time:** ~2 minutes

**Potential Follow-ups:**
- How did you convince the engineers' managers?
- What was the trade-off with the third-party service?
- What would you do differently?

### Story #2: The Heated Disagreement

**Quick Summary:** Resolved conflict with senior colleague over architectural decision.

**Tags:** #conflict #collaboration #technical

**Usable for Questions About:**
- Tell me about a conflict with a coworker
- Describe a time you disagreed with someone senior
- How do you handle disagreements?

---

**SITUATION**
Our team was redesigning the notification system. A senior architect strongly advocated for a microservices approach, while I believed a simpler monolithic solution would serve us better given our team size and timeline.

**TASK**
I needed to either convince him of my position or find a way to align despite our different views, without damaging the relationship.

**ACTION**
Rather than arguing in public meetings, I asked if we could grab coffee and walk through both approaches. I prepared a comparison document showing trade-offs honestly—including where his approach had advantages. During our conversation, I focused on understanding his concerns: scalability, team growth, and future flexibility. I acknowledged these were valid but presented data on our actual traffic patterns and a 6-month team growth projection. I proposed a compromise: we'd build it modular enough that we could split into services later, but start simple. I offered to document the decision and take ownership if it went wrong.

**RESULT**
He agreed to the compromise. Six months later, the simpler architecture was still serving us well at 3x the traffic. He actually thanked me for pushing back and said it changed how he approaches technical decisions—considering team context, not just ideal architecture. We've collaborated well since.

**Talking Time:** ~2 minutes

**Potential Follow-ups:**
- What if he hadn't agreed?
- How did you handle the emotional aspects?
- What did you learn about yourself?
