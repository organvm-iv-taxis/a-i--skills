# Facilitation Scripts

Ready-to-use scripts for common workshop moments.

## Opening a Session

### Warm Welcome

```
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. I'm [Name], and I'll be
facilitating today's [session/workshop] on [topic].

Before we dive in, a few housekeeping items:
- We'll be here until [time]
- We'll take a break around [time]
- [Restrooms/cameras/mute policy as relevant]
- Feel free to [grab coffee/step away as needed]

Any questions before we begin?"
```

### Setting Expectations

```
"By the end of today, you'll be able to:
- [Learning objective 1]
- [Learning objective 2]
- [Learning objective 3]

We'll get there through a mix of [discussion, hands-on work,
exercises]—so expect to be active participants, not just
listeners."
```

### Creating Psychological Safety

```
"A few ground rules for our time together:

- There are no dumb questions—if you're thinking it, others
  probably are too
- What's shared here stays here [if appropriate]
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- All perspectives are welcome, even—especially—dissenting ones

This works best when everyone participates. I'll create
opportunities for both speaking up and quieter reflection."
```

### Icebreaker Setup

```
"Let's start by getting to know each other a bit. In a moment,
I'll ask you to [share/do activity].

Here's what we'll do:
[Explain activity clearly]

I'll go first as an example:
[Demonstrate]

Now, let's go around [clockwise/popcorn style]. [Name], would
you like to start us off?"
```

---

## Managing Activities

### Launching an Activity

```
"Okay, time for [activity name]. Here's how it works:

[Step 1: Explain clearly]
[Step 2: Set time expectation]
[Step 3: Clarify any roles]

You'll have [X] minutes. I'll give you a 2-minute warning.

Any questions before we start?
[Pause for questions]

Go ahead and begin."
```

### Time Warnings

```
"You have 2 minutes left."

"One more minute—start wrapping up your thoughts."

"Let's bring it back together in 30 seconds."
```

### Calling Time

```
"Alright, let's pause there. If you're mid-thought, you can
jot down a quick note.

Let's come back together as a group."
```

### Transitioning Between Activities

```
"Great work on [previous activity].

Before we move on, let me capture a few key points:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]

Now we're going to build on that with [next activity]..."
```

---

## Facilitating Discussion

### Opening a Discussion

```
"I'd love to hear your thoughts on [topic/question].

[Pause 3-5 seconds for thinking]

Who'd like to start us off?"
```

### If No One Speaks

```
"Take a moment to think about this. I'll give you 30 seconds
to jot down a thought, then we'll share.

[Wait]

Okay, [Name], what did you come up with?"
```

### Encouraging Participation

```
"That's a great point, [Name]. Let's hear from someone who
hasn't spoken yet."

"[Name], I noticed you nodding—what's your take?"

"Let's hear a different perspective. Anyone see it another way?"
```

### Managing Dominant Voices

```
"Thanks, [Name]. I want to make sure we hear from others too.
[Other name], what's your thought?"

"That's interesting—let's pause there and get some other
voices in."

"I'm going to ask us to practice the 'step up, step back'
approach—if you've been speaking a lot, step back a bit."
```

### Handling Off-Topic Comments

```
"That's interesting and worth exploring. Let me capture that
in our parking lot so we don't lose it, and we can come back
if time allows."

"That's a good point, though it's a bit outside our focus today.
Can we table that for now and discuss after?"
```

### Redirecting Tangents

```
"I appreciate that thought. Let me bring us back to [topic].
How does [their point] connect to [main question]?"

"Let's file that away for now and refocus on [topic].
We can revisit in Q&A if there's time."
```

---

## Handling Questions

### When You Don't Know

```
"That's a great question, and honestly, I don't know the
answer off the top of my head. Let me note it down and get
back to you after [session/research]."

"I'm not sure—does anyone else have insight on that?"
```

### Deferring Questions

```
"We're going to cover that in about [X] minutes. Can you
hold onto that thought until then?"

"That's a great question. I'd love to explore it during
our Q&A time at the end."
```

### Clarifying Questions

```
"Just to make sure I understand—are you asking about [X]
or [Y]?"

"Can you say more about what you mean by [term]?"

"What prompted that question? That might help me give
you a better answer."
```

---

## Energy Management

### When Energy is Low

```
"Let's do a quick stretch. Stand up if you can, and take
30 seconds to move around."

"I can feel the energy dipping—let's take a 5-minute break.
Be back at [time]."

"Time for a quick activity. Turn to your neighbor and share
[quick prompt]. You have 2 minutes."
```

### When a Topic Gets Heavy

```
"That's heavy content. Let's take a breath here.
[Pause]
Any reactions or thoughts?"

"I want to acknowledge that was a lot. What's landing for
you right now?"
```

### After a Break

```
"Welcome back! Before we dive in, quick check-in: On a scale
of 1-5 in the chat, how's your energy level?

[Adjust pace based on response]"
```

---

## Closing a Session

### Summarizing Key Points

```
"Let's recap what we covered today:

1. [Key point 1]
2. [Key point 2]
3. [Key point 3]

The main takeaway I hope you leave with is [core message]."
```

### Final Reflection

```
"Before we close, I'd like each person to share one thing:
[Choose one]
- One thing you're taking away
- One thing you'll do differently
- One word to describe your experience

I'll start: [Your example]

[Go around room or ask for volunteers]"
```

### Call to Action

```
"So, what's next?

I encourage you to [specific action] within the next [timeframe].

[Resources] are available at [location].

If you want to continue the conversation, [next steps]."
```

### Thank You and Close

```
"Thank you all for your participation and engagement today.
Your insights made this session richer.

I'm available for questions until [time] if anyone wants to chat.

[Feedback request if applicable]

Thanks again, and have a great [rest of your day/week]!"
```

---

## Handling Difficult Moments

### Disagreement Between Participants

```
"It sounds like there are different perspectives here. That's
valuable—let's make sure we understand both sides.

[Name 1], can you summarize your view in one sentence?
[Name 2], same for you?

It seems like the core difference is [X]. Does that sound right?"
```

### When Someone is Upset

```
"I can see this is important to you. Thank you for being
willing to share that.

[To group] Let's take a moment to sit with what [Name] shared."

[If appropriate] "Would you like to talk more about this during
the break?"
```

### When You Make a Mistake

```
"I want to correct something I said earlier. I mentioned [X],
but actually [correct information]. Thank you for your patience."

"I misspoke. What I meant was [correction]. Appreciate your
understanding."
```

### Technical Difficulties

```
"We're having some technical difficulties. Let's take a
5-minute break while we sort this out.

In the meantime, feel free to [chat with neighbors/review
materials/grab coffee]."
```

## Virtual-Specific Scripts

### Opening Virtual Session

```
"Welcome, everyone. A few virtual housekeeping items:

- Please stay muted when not speaking to reduce background noise
- Feel free to use the chat for questions or reactions
- If you have connection issues, try turning your camera off
- I'll use breakout rooms for small group work

Let's start with a quick camera and audio check. Can everyone
give me a thumbs up or wave?"
```

### Breakout Room Instructions

```
"We're going into breakout rooms of [N] people for [X] minutes.

In your rooms, please:
1. [Specific instruction 1]
2. [Specific instruction 2]
3. Be ready to share one insight when we return

I'll pop into rooms to check in. You'll get a 1-minute warning.

Any questions before I open the rooms?"
```

### Returning from Breakout Rooms

```
"Welcome back! Let's hear highlights from each group.

[Group 1], what was one key insight from your discussion?"
```
