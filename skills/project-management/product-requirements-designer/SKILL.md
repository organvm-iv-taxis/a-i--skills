description: Comprehensive product requirements documentation from problem definition through launch planning. Supports both enterprise PRD (full specs, cross-functional alignment) and lean/startup style (hypothesis-driven one-pagers). Framework-agnostic with templates for Agile, Jobs-to-Be-Done, and hybrid approaches. Scaffolds related artifacts including user stories, acceptance criteria, wireframes brief, and technical handoff specs.

# Product Requirements Designer

Transform product vision into actionable specifications.

## Mode Selection

### Document Scope

**Enterprise PRD**: Full cross-functional specification
- Complete problem analysis with market context
- Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- Success metrics with measurement plans
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Full launch and rollout plan
- Stakeholder sign-off sections

**Lean PRD**: Hypothesis-driven one-pager
- Problem/opportunity statement
- Proposed solution with key assumptions
- MVP scope and success criteria
- Learning goals and experiment design
- Quick iteration plan

### Framework Selection

**Agile/Scrum**: Epics → Features → User Stories → Acceptance Criteria

**Jobs-to-Be-Done**: Job statement → Forces diagram → Solution mapping

**Outcome-Driven**: Desired outcomes → Opportunity scoring → Solution requirements

**Hybrid**: Mix frameworks based on product stage and team needs
