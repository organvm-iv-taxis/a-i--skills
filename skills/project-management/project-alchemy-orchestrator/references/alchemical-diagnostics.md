# Alchemical Diagnostics Guide

Framework for diagnosing project stages and prescribing appropriate operations.

## The Four Stages

### Nigredo (Blackening)

**Symptoms**:
- Everything feels chaotic
- Scope is undefined or infinite
- Multiple contradictory directions
- Paralysis from too many options
- "I don't know where to start"
- Previous assumptions no longer hold

**Diagnostic Questions**:
```
1. Can you state the project's purpose in one sentence?
   No → Nigredo

2. Is the scope bounded?
   No → Nigredo

3. Are you avoiding the project?
   Yes (because overwhelmed) → Nigredo
```

**Prescribed Operations**:

| Operation | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Calcination** | Burn away the inessential | Delete 80% of scope, keep core |
| **Dissolution** | Return to liquid state | Abandon structure, free-write |
| **Putrefaction** | Let it rot productively | Step away, let unconscious work |

**Nigredo Rituals**:
```
Morning Burn:
- Write everything about the project (10 min)
- Circle the ONE essential thing
- Cross out everything else
- Work only on the circled item

Dissolution Bath:
- Remove all structure (outlines, plans)
- Generate 20 wild variations
- Look for unexpected patterns
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- Single clear thesis/purpose
- Bounded scope (can list what's NOT included)
- Energy to engage (not dread)

### Albedo (Whitening)

**Symptoms**:
- Core idea is clear
- Structure is emerging
- Separating "what stays" from "what goes"
- Creating categories and distinctions
- "Now I see the parts"

**Diagnostic Questions**:
```
1. Can you name the major components?
   Yes → Albedo

2. Is the boundary between inside/outside clear?
   Yes → Albedo

3. Are you making structural decisions?
   Yes → Albedo
```

**Prescribed Operations**:

| Operation | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Separation** | Divide into distinct parts | Create sections, modules |
| **Filtration** | Remove impurities | Edit ruthlessly |
| **Distillation** | Concentrate essence | Find the core of each part |

**Albedo Rituals**:
```
Separation Grid:
- List all components
- Assign each to a category
- Identify orphans (don't fit anywhere)
- Either create new category or cut

Purity Test:
- For each section: "Does this serve the whole?"
- If no clear answer: cut or transform
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- Clear structure (outline, architecture)
- Each part has defined purpose
- No redundancy or overlap

### Citrinitas (Yellowing)

**Symptoms**:
- Structure is solid
- Ready for external feedback
- Dawn of public engagement
- Testing against reality
- "Time to show someone"

**Diagnostic Questions**:
```
1. Is the internal structure complete?
   Yes → ready for Citrinitas

2. Are you curious how others will respond?
   Yes → Citrinitas

3. Does it feel "true" but untested?
   Yes → Citrinitas
```

**Prescribed Operations**:

| Operation | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Fermentation** | Introduce living element | Show to trusted readers |
| **Solarization** | Expose to light | Public process, drafts |
| **Cibation** | Feed and nourish | Iterate based on feedback |

**Citrinitas Rituals**:
```
First Light:
- Share with ONE trusted person
- Ask: "What's unclear? What's missing?"
- Listen without defending

Public Process:
- Publish work-in-progress
- Invite specific feedback
- Document reactions and adjustments
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- External validation received
- Major feedback incorporated
- Confidence in direction (not just internal)

---

### Rubedo (Reddening)

**Symptoms**:
- Work is substantially complete
- Focus shifts to packaging, delivery
- Integration with existing systems
- "Time to ship"
- Sustainability planning

**Diagnostic Questions**:
```
1. Is the core work done?
   Yes → Rubedo

2. Is the focus on delivery/packaging?
   Yes → Rubedo

3. Are you thinking about maintenance?
   Yes → Rubedo
```

**Prescribed Operations**:

| Operation | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Coagulation** | Fix into final form | Ship, publish, deliver |
| **Fixation** | Make permanent | Documentation, archival |
| **Multiplication** | Increase effect | Distribution, marketing |

**Rubedo Rituals**:
```
Ship Deadline:
- Set immovable date
- Define "done enough"
- Execute without renegotiation

Integration Check:
- How does this connect to other work?
- What systems need updating?
- Who needs to know?
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- Work is shipped/published
- Documentation complete
- Maintenance plan exists

## Stage Transition Guide

### Nigredo → Albedo

**Trigger**: Clarity emerges from chaos
**Sign**: You can name the thing
**Action**: Begin structuring

### Albedo → Citrinitas

**Trigger**: Structure feels complete
**Sign**: Desire for external input
**Action**: Find first reader/user

### Citrinitas → Rubedo

**Trigger**: Feedback integrated
**Sign**: Confidence in direction
**Action**: Set ship date

### Rubedo → (New Nigredo)

**Trigger**: Project complete or transformation needed
**Sign**: Stability or stagnation
**Action**: Archive or decompose for next cycle

## Common Traps

### Premature Albedo

**Symptom**: Structuring chaos too early
**Result**: Rigid structure that doesn't fit
**Fix**: Return to Nigredo, burn the structure

### Skipping Citrinitas

**Symptom**: Shipping without external validation
**Result**: Work doesn't land, misses audience
**Fix**: Pause, get feedback, iterate

### Endless Albedo

**Symptom**: Perfecting structure forever
**Result**: Never ships, "not ready yet"
**Fix**: Force Citrinitas exposure

### Premature Rubedo

**Symptom**: Shipping before structure is sound
**Result**: Unstable product, constant fixes
**Fix**: Return to Albedo, complete structure

## Quick Diagnostic Matrix

| Signal | Likely Stage | Recommended Operation |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| "I don't know where to start" | Nigredo | Calcination |
| "Everything is chaos" | Nigredo | Dissolution |
| "I see the parts now" | Albedo | Separation |
| "This section doesn't fit" | Albedo | Filtration |
| "Is this any good?" | Citrinitas | Fermentation |
| "Time to show someone" | Citrinitas | Solarization |
| "How do I package this?" | Rubedo | Coagulation |
| "It's done but feels dead" | Rubedo→Nigredo | New cycle |
