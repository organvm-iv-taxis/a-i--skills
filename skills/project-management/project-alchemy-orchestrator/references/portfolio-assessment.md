# Portfolio Assessment Template

Framework for mapping a creative portfolio across organs, stages, and fields.

## System Topology Audit

### Organ Inventory

Map each active project to its primary organ.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ORCHESTRATION LAYER                       │
│         (connects, routes, decides what moves where)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │                    │                    │

**Project Mapping Template**:

| Project | Primary Organ | Secondary Organ | Stage | Health |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| [Name] | Conceptual | - | Albedo | Green |
| [Name] | Commerce | Art | Rubedo | Yellow |
| [Name] | Art | - | Nigredo | Red |

### Organ Balance Assessment

**Target Distribution** (adjust to your situation):
- Conceptual: 20% (feeds the others)
- Art: 40% (core expression)
- Commerce: 40% (sustains the whole)

**Current Distribution**:
```
Conceptual:  [████████░░] 40%
Art:         [██░░░░░░░░] 20%
Commerce:    [████░░░░░░] 40%

Assessment: Art is starving. Commerce and Conceptual are fed.
```

## Four Fields Energy Audit

Rate your current energy allocation (1-10) in each field.

### Present Waking

Reality-based work, observation, friction with the world.

```
Questions:
- Am I engaging with material constraints?
- Am I responding to actual feedback?
- Am I present in the physical work?

Score: [  ] /10

Signs of deficit:
- Work feels abstract, disconnected
- Ignoring user/audience feedback
- Avoiding the difficult parts

Signs of excess:
- Burnout from constant friction
- No space for imagination
- Only responding, never initiating
```

### Present Dreaming

Unconscious synthesis, surrealism, play.

```
Questions:
- Am I allowing unexpected connections?
- Is there play in my process?
- Am I capturing dream/shower thoughts?

Score: [  ] /10

Signs of deficit:
- Work feels mechanical
- No surprising elements
- "Going through the motions"

Signs of excess:
- Endless ideation, no execution
- Projects never land
- Beautiful ideas, no artifacts
```

### Temporal Antagonism

Pressure of past (memory, trauma) and future (ambition, fear).

```
Questions:
- Am I connected to why this matters?
- Is history/legacy informing the work?
- Is future vision pulling me forward?

Score: [  ] /10

Signs of deficit:
- Work feels pointless
- No sense of stakes
- "Why am I doing this?"

Signs of excess:
- Paralyzed by significance
- Cannot separate self from work
- Everything is too important to ship
```

### Binding/Translation

The metabolic work of craft, revision, form.

```
Questions:
- Am I doing the craft work?
- Is insight becoming artifact?
- Am I revising and refining?

Score: [  ] /10

Signs of deficit:
- Ideas stay as ideas
- "Great concept, poor execution"
- Avoiding the hard work of making

Signs of excess:
- Endless polishing
- Cannot ship
- Craft becomes procrastination
```

### Field Balance Visualization

                  │ [score]
                  │
               Binding

Ideal: Roughly balanced, slight emphasis based on project stage
```

## Stage-Appropriate Energy

Match field emphasis to alchemical stage.

| Stage | Primary Field | Secondary Field |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Nigredo | Present Dreaming | Temporal Antagonism |
| Albedo | Binding | Present Waking |
| Citrinitas | Present Waking | Temporal Antagonism |
| Rubedo | Binding | Present Waking |

## Boundary Audit

### Marketing vs Community

```
MARKETING (Mechanical Beacon)        COMMUNITY (Human Garden)
─────────────────────────────        ─────────────────────────
- One-to-many                        - Many-to-many
- Broadcast                          - Dialogue
- Metrics: reach, conversion         - Metrics: depth, trust
- Can be automated                   - Must be tended
- Attracts strangers                 - Nurtures relationships

Check: Am I treating community as marketing?
       Am I expecting marketing to build community?
```

### Commerce vs Art

```
COMMERCE (Must Pay)                  ART (Must Be True)
─────────────────────                ───────────────────
- Success = revenue                  - Success = truth
- Audience defines value             - Artist defines value
- Compromise is normal               - Compromise is death
- Efficiency matters                 - Efficiency irrelevant
- Can be delegated                   - Cannot be delegated

Check: Am I expecting art to pay?
       Am I expecting commerce to be true?
```

## Quarterly Review Template

### Portfolio Health Dashboard

```markdown
## Q[X] Portfolio Review

### Organ Status
| Organ | Projects | Energy | Trend |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| Conceptual | [count] | [%] | [↑↓→] |
| Art | [count] | [%] | [↑↓→] |
| Commerce | [count] | [%] | [↑↓→] |

### Stage Distribution
| Stage | Projects | Stuck? |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Nigredo | [count] | [Y/N] |
| Albedo | [count] | [Y/N] |
| Citrinitas | [count] | [Y/N] |
| Rubedo | [count] | [Y/N] |

### Field Balance
- Present Waking: [score]/10
- Present Dreaming: [score]/10
- Temporal Antagonism: [score]/10
- Binding: [score]/10

### Boundary Violations
- [ ] Marketing treated as Community
- [ ] Art expected to pay
- [ ] Commerce expected to be art
- [ ] Other: [describe]

### Conservation Law Check
"No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me."

Projects without resistance:
- [Project]: Move to [new field] or [complete/abandon]

### Next Quarter Focus
- Primary Organ: [which needs attention]
- Stage Goal: [what should advance]
- Field Rebalance: [what to adjust]
```

---

## Quick Diagnostics

### "I'm stuck on this project"

1. Which organ does it belong to?
2. What stage is it in?
3. Which field am I working from?
4. Is there still resistance?

→ Prescribe operation based on stage
→ Shift field if stuck
→ Move or complete if no resistance

### "I have too many projects"

1. Map all to organs
2. Identify which organ is overloaded
3. Move projects to Dormant or Archive
4. Maintain max 2-3 active per organ

### "Nothing feels meaningful"

1. Check Temporal Antagonism score
2. Reconnect to history/legacy
3. Reconnect to future vision
4. If still empty: allow Nigredo (it may need to die)
