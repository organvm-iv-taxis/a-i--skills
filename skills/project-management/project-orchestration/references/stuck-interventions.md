# Stuck Interventions

Detailed strategies for getting unstuck on projects.

## Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Name the Block

Before intervening, identify what type of stuck you're experiencing.

| Block Type | Feels Like | Root Cause |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Unclear** | "I don't know what to do" | Missing information or decision |
| **Fear** | "I'm avoiding this" | Risk of failure, judgment, or loss |
| **Overwhelm** | "There's too much" | Scope too large, can't see path |
| **Boredom** | "I don't care anymore" | Lost connection to meaning |
| **Perfectionism** | "It's not good enough" | Standards blocking progress |
| **External** | "I'm waiting on X" | Dependency outside your control |
| **Exhaustion** | "I can't think" | Resource depletion |

### Step 2: Match Intervention

Each block type has specific interventions. Using the wrong intervention makes things worse.

## Block: Unclear

**Symptoms**:
- Staring at the project without acting
- "What am I supposed to do?"
- Repeating the same analysis
- Task feels fuzzy

### Interventions

**1. Define Done First**
```
Ask: "What does finished look like?"

Write a single sentence describing the completed state.
If you can't, that's the problem—clarity needed, not action.

Example:
Before: "Work on the presentation"
After: "Slide deck with 10 slides explaining Q3 results to board"
```

**2. Find the Smallest Step**
```
The 2-Minute Rule:
What action takes less than 2 minutes that moves this forward?

Examples:
- Open the document
- Write one sentence
- Send one question
- Make one list

Do that action immediately.
```

**3. Ask Clarifying Questions**
```
Questions that create clarity:
- What is this project actually about?
- Who is it for?
- What's the single most important thing?
- What would make this a failure?
- What do I need to know that I don't?

Write answers. Clarity often follows.
```

**4. Talk It Through**
```
Explain the project to someone (or rubber duck).
Where you stumble = where you're unclear.
Address that gap.
```

## Block: Fear

**Symptoms**:
- Active avoidance
- Procrastination with other "urgent" tasks
- Physical tension thinking about it
- "I'll do it later when I'm ready"

### Interventions

**1. Name the Fear**
```
Complete these sentences:
- I'm afraid this will...
- If this fails, people will think...
- The worst case is...
- I'm avoiding finding out that...

Speaking the fear reduces its power.
```

**2. Lower the Stakes**
```
Frame shifts:
- "This is a draft" (not final)
- "This is practice" (not performance)
- "This is an experiment" (not commitment)
- "No one will see this" (remove audience)

Create a version with zero consequences.
```

**3. Set a Failure Target**
```
Paradoxical intervention:
"Write the worst possible version on purpose"

This bypasses perfectionism and often produces
something surprisingly usable.
```

**4. Time-Box Exposure**
```
"I will work on this for exactly 15 minutes"

Bounded exposure reduces fear.
Set timer. Work. Stop when it rings.
Fear decreases with repeated exposure.
```

**5. Identify the Actual Risk**
```
Reality-test:
- What's the realistic worst case? (Not catastrophic fantasy)
- Has anyone died from [this type of failure]?
- What would I tell a friend in this situation?
- Will this matter in 5 years?
```

## Block: Overwhelm

**Symptoms**:
- Paralysis
- Can't choose where to start
- Everything feels equally urgent
- Mental spinning

### Interventions

**1. Radical Scope Cut**
```
Cut 80%:
"If I could only do ONE part of this, what would it be?"

Do only that. Expand later if needed.
This isn't giving up—it's strategic focus.
```

**2. Create a List, Then Ignore Most**
```
Brain dump everything into a list.
Star the 3 most important items.
Cross out or defer everything else.
Work only from the starred items.
```

**3. First Things First**
```
What has to happen before anything else can?
Do that first. Ignore dependencies that come later.

Often overwhelm = trying to hold the whole system.
Hold only the next link in the chain.
```

**4. Change Scale**
```
Zoom out: "What's the 10,000-foot view?"
Zoom in: "What's the next 10 minutes?"

Often we're stuck at the wrong altitude.
Switch perspectives.
```

**5. Physical Reset**
```
Overwhelm is often physiological:
- Walk for 10 minutes
- Drink water
- Take 5 deep breaths
- Change location

Then return to the smallest action.
```

## Block: Boredom

**Symptoms**:
- "This doesn't matter"
- No energy for the work
- Going through motions
- Resentment toward the project

### Interventions

**1. Reconnect to Why**
```
Answer:
- Why did I start this?
- Who benefits when this is done?
- What changes when this ships?

If no compelling answers: consider abandoning.
```

**2. Find the Interesting Part**
```
Every project has one interesting angle.
- What's the intellectual puzzle?
- What skill could I develop?
- What would make this fun?

Reframe around that angle.
```

**3. Add Constraint**
```
Boredom often = too much freedom.

Add artificial constraints:
- "Do it in half the time"
- "Use only these tools"
- "Make it fit on one page"

Constraints create interesting problems.
```

**4. Change Modality**
```
Stuck in writing? → Sketch it
Stuck in planning? → Just start building
Stuck in analysis? → Talk to someone

Switch from verbal to visual, or thinking to doing.
```

**5. Accept and Finish**
```
Sometimes boring work just needs doing.
Acknowledge: "This is boring. I'm doing it anyway."
Don't make it interesting. Just complete it.
```

## Block: Perfectionism

**Symptoms**:
- Endless revision
- "Not ready yet"
- Comparing to ideal
- Unable to call it done

### Interventions

**1. Define "Good Enough"**
```
Before starting, write:
"This is good enough when: _______________"

Be specific. Then stop when you reach that bar.
```

**2. Ship Deadline**
```
Set immovable external deadline:
- Tell someone you'll deliver by [date]
- Schedule the meeting that requires it
- Post publicly that it's coming

External commitment breaks perfectionism.
```

**3. Publish the Imperfect**
```
Ship something embarrassingly incomplete.
Notice: the world doesn't end.
This recalibrates your "good enough" bar.
```

**4. Separate Create and Edit**
```
Perfectionism often intrudes during creation.
Rule: No editing until draft is complete.

Two sessions: Create (no judgment) → Edit (judgment welcome)
```

**5. Satisfice, Don't Maximize**
```
Good enough is the enemy of never.

Ask: "Is this satisfactory?"
Not: "Is this the best possible?"
```

## Block: External Dependency

**Symptoms**:
- "Waiting on X"
- Progress depends on others
- Out of your control

### Interventions

**1. Follow Up Proactively**
```
Don't wait silently.
- Send reminder
- Offer to help unblock
- Escalate if needed

Be the squeaky wheel.
```

**2. Route Around**
```
Can you:
- Find an alternative source?
- Do a different part first?
- Make an assumption and proceed?
- Build a placeholder?

Progress on anything is better than waiting.
```

**3. Set a Timeout**
```
"If I don't hear by [date], I will [action]"

Communicate this clearly.
Then execute if needed.
```

**4. Work on Something Else**
```
Accept the block. Switch to another project.
Return when unblocked.

This is not failure—it's resource management.
```

---

## Block: Exhaustion

**Symptoms**:
- Can't think clearly
- Everything feels hard
- Physical tiredness
- Emotional depletion

### Interventions

**1. Rest**
```
This is not a productivity problem.
It's a resource problem.

Sleep. Take a day off. Exercise. Eat well.
Return when resources are restored.
```

**2. Do the Minimum**
```
If rest isn't possible:
What's the absolute minimum to maintain momentum?
Do only that. Nothing more.
```

**3. Change the Type of Work**
```
Exhaustion is often type-specific.
Mentally exhausted? Do physical tasks.
Creatively exhausted? Do routine tasks.
Socially exhausted? Work alone.
```

**4. Lower Standards Temporarily**
```
"Today's work will be C-grade, and that's fine."

Permission to underperform preserves progress.
```

## Quick Reference Card

```
STUCK? → IDENTIFY TYPE → APPLY INTERVENTION

Unclear     → Define done, find smallest step
Fear        → Name it, lower stakes, time-box
Overwhelm   → Cut 80%, list then ignore, zoom in/out
Boredom     → Reconnect why, add constraint, change mode
Perfectionism → Define "good enough", ship deadline
External    → Follow up, route around, switch projects
Exhaustion  → Rest, do minimum, change work type
```
