```

**Counter:**

### Reasonable Confidentiality

**Original:**
```
All information disclosed by Client is confidential forever.
```

**Counter:**
```
"Confidential Information" means information clearly marked

EFFECT OF TERMINATION: Upon termination for any reason,

### Initial Redline Request

```
Subject: Contract Review - Proposed Modifications

Hi [Name],

Thank you for sending the agreement. I've reviewed it and

Please find my redlined version attached.

Key changes:
1. Payment terms adjusted to Net 30
2. Added revision cap of 2 rounds
3. Retained portfolio rights
4. Capped liability at contract value

Happy to discuss any of these. Looking forward to working together.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Pushing Back on Non-Negotiable Response

```
Subject: Re: Contract Terms

Hi [Name],

I understand these are your standard terms. Let me explain
why these specific changes are important:

[Unlimited liability clause] - This exposes me to risk
disproportionate to the project value. Capping at 1x the
contract value is industry standard and protects both parties.

[No kill fee] - If the project is cancelled mid-stream,
I need compensation for the time blocked on my calendar
and lost opportunity cost.

Would you be able to get approval for these specific changes?
I'm flexible on other terms.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Walking Away Professionally

```
Subject: Re: Contract Terms - Unable to Proceed

Hi [Name],

Thank you for considering my requested changes. Unfortunately,
without modifications to [specific clauses], I'm unable to
accept the risk this agreement presents.

I enjoyed our discussions and would be happy to reconsider
if circumstances change. Please feel free to reach out for
future projects.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
