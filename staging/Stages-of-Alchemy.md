## Q: 
what are the stages of alchemy?

## A: 
## The canonical stage-models you’ll see in alchemy

“Stages of alchemy” is not one single standardized list; different authors, periods, and lineages use different schemata. In practice, most modern summaries reduce to either a **4-stage color cycle** or a **3-stage (tria prima–style) work cycle**, and sometimes a **7- or 12-stage expansion** built on top of those.

## 1) The four color stages (most commonly cited)

### Nigredo — “blackening”

Decomposition, putrefaction, dissolution of the initial form; breakdown of impurities and fixed identities. Symbolically: darkness, death, chaos, the “prima materia” in crisis.

### Albedo — “whitening”

Purification, washing, clarification, separation of the subtle from the gross; the matter becomes “cleaned” and more receptive. Symbolically: cleansing, lunar light, restored order.

### Citrinitas — “yellowing”

Maturation, dawning illumination, consolidation of understanding; historically sometimes minimized or folded into rubedo in later texts. Symbolically: sunrise, solarization, awakening.

### Rubedo — “reddening”

Completion, integration, “fixing” the transformation into a stable new form; union of opposites. Symbolically: culmination, embodiment, the stone/elixir as realized outcome.

## 2) A very common three-stage variant

Many sources compress the work into three:  
**Nigredo → Albedo → Rubedo**, treating **citrinitas** as a transitional phase (or as part of rubedo).

## 3) The operational “lab” framing (often mapped onto the above)

You’ll also see the work described as repeating operations rather than colors, with many-to-one mapping onto the four stages:

**Solve et coagula** — dissolve (break down) and coagulate (re-form).  
Common sub-operations include: **calcination, dissolution, separation, conjunction, fermentation, distillation, coagulation**. These are often presented as a 7-step ladder (especially in modern esoteric summaries), though historical texts vary on names and order.

## A practical way to remember it

If you want a functional mnemonic rather than a historical one:  
**Break down → Purify → Illuminate/Mature → Integrate and Fix.**

If you tell me whether you mean **historical Western laboratory alchemy**, **psychological/Jungian alchemy**, or **esoteric/occult tradition summaries**, I can give you the most appropriate stage list and the most standard operation-sequence for that lens.

## Q: 
unpack all three: historical Western laboratory alchemy, psychological/Jungian alchemy, & esoteric/occult tradition summaries

## A: 
## 1) Historical Western laboratory alchemy (late antique → medieval → early modern)

### What “stages” meant in practice

In laboratory alchemy, “stages” are not a single canonical checklist. Texts oscillate between:

A. **Color-phase narratives** describing what the operator sees in the vessel (the “signs” of the work).  
B. **Operational sequences** describing what the operator does (calcine, dissolve, distill, etc.).  
C. **Goal-states** describing what the operator is trying to achieve (purification, fixation, projection, medicine).

These interlock, but they are not always in one-to-one correspondence.

### The color phases (the “signs”)

The most stable historical scaffold is the **color progression**. You already have the four-stage variant; historically, it’s best treated as a diagnostic overlay rather than a strict recipe.

#### Nigredo (blackening)

A cluster of phenomena indicating breakdown, putrefaction, or “death of the form.” In lab language this often correlates with strong decomposition, darkening, sludge/precipitate, or a “corrupt” phase before clarification.

#### Albedo (whitening)

Signs of clarification and purification: whitening, brightening, or “washing.” The matter is described as cleaner, more volatile/subtle, or separated.

#### Citrinitas (yellowing)

In many early sources this is a distinct “dawning” phase, a maturation of the purified matter toward a solar quality. In later European traditions it is sometimes compressed into rubedo, but historically you still find it named as its own threshold.

#### Rubedo (reddening)

The culminating “fixing” and integration: the work becomes stable and complete; the “medicine” is considered ready (at least in that cycle). “Red” is both a literal color-sign and a symbolic claim of completion.

### The operational ladder (what the operator does)

A widely used early modern teaching scaffold is the **seven operations**. Treat this as a pedagogical map, not a universally attested historical sequence.

#### Calcination

Thermal breakdown: reducing the “body” to ash/calp, weakening stubborn structure, driving off volatile impurities.

#### Dissolution

Breaking the calcined matter into a solvent/menstruum; making the fixed mobile.

#### Separation

Sorting subtle from gross; extracting fractions; isolating what is useful.

#### Conjunction

Reuniting purified fractions into a new compound; controlled recombination.

#### Fermentation

Introducing a “seed” or catalytic principle; a qualitative leap (not merely more cleaning).

#### Distillation

Refining volatility and purity through repeated vapor–condense cycles; concentrating “spirit.”

#### Coagulation (Fixation)

Returning the refined volatile into a stable body; “fixing” the transformation so it persists.

### Solve et coagula in historical context

Historically, **solve et coagula** is better understood as a repeated **rhythm** than a single step: dissolve what is fixed, then fix what is volatile, cycling until a stable medicine is achieved.

### The three principles (tria prima) as a stage framework

In Paracelsian and spagyric traditions, stage-thinking often shifts to a **principle-extraction** model:

“Salt / Sulfur / Mercury” are not modern chemicals; they are explanatory categories.  
Mercury ≈ volatility/spirit; Sulfur ≈ combustibility/“soul”/oiliness; Salt ≈ fixed body/ash/mineral remainder.

In spagyric practice, the “stages” can be: extract the volatile, separate the principles, purify each, then recombine into an improved whole.

## 2) Psychological / Jungian alchemy (alchemy as a map of psyche)

### What “stages” mean here

Jung treats alchemical imagery as **projection**: the operator experiences transformations in matter that also mirror transformations in the psyche. The “work” is read as a symbolic narrative of **individuation** (integration of the personality, including the unconscious).

A key difference from lab alchemy: Jungian stages are not validated by vessel-phenomena; they’re validated by **psychic content** (dreams, affects, compulsions, shadow material, integration).

### The color phases as psychological processes

Jungian readings preserve the classic color cycle because it maps cleanly onto common psychological dynamics.

#### Nigredo (blackening) → confrontation with the Shadow

Experiences: depression, confusion, disgust, meaning-collapse, obsession, loss of old identity, “putrefaction” of ego certainties. Functionally: the psyche stops pretending the old story works.

#### Albedo (whitening) → clarification and purification

Experiences: insight, differentiation, increased reflective capacity, the ability to separate “what I feel” from “what is.” Often includes a cooling of raw affect and the emergence of an observing stance.

#### Citrinitas (yellowing) → dawning consciousness

Experiences: a sustained illumination that is not merely relief; a new orientation. In Jung-adjacent work this is sometimes treated as a shift from “lunar” reflection (albedo) to “solar” agency (citrinitas).

#### Rubedo (reddening) → integration and embodiment

Experiences: reconciliation of opposites (conscious/unconscious, masculine/feminine as psychic functions, persona/shadow), and crucially, embodiment—life changes that make the integration real.

### Additional Jungian stage motifs you will see

Jung also emphasizes recurring alchemical motifs that function like sub-stages:

“Separatio” (differentiation)  
“Coniunctio” (union of opposites)  
The appearance of the “Self” as regulating center (often symbolized by the lapis/stone, mandala, king/queen, divine child)

These are not linear; they recur.

### The “chemical wedding” as a psychological arc

Many Jungian maps treat the core drama as: destabilization → differentiation → encounter/union of opposites → stabilization at a higher level. That is essentially solve/coagula applied to identity.

## 3) Esoteric / occult tradition summaries (Hermetic, Rosicrucian, modern ceremonial syntheses)

### What “stages” mean here

Occult systems often treat alchemy as a **multi-domain practice** spanning:

“Laboratory craft (sometimes)”  
“Ritual and meditation”  
“Moral/initiatory purification”  
“Cosmology and correspondences (planets, metals, sephiroth, elements)”

Because these systems are synthetic and lineage-dependent, you will see more standardized stage-lists used for instruction—even when those lists are not historically uniform.

### The common “7-step” esoteric sequence (popular modern summary)

This is the familiar modern ladder that maps operations to inner work. Names and order vary by author, but the standard set is:

Calcination → dissolution → separation → conjunction → fermentation → distillation → coagulation

In occult usage, each step is typically assigned:

A psychological task (ego-breakdown, emotional softening, discernment, integration, inspiration, refinement, embodiment)  
A spiritual task (purification, awakening, consecration, stabilization)  
Sometimes a planetary or elemental correspondence

### The Great Work framing (initiatory completion)

Occult alchemy frequently centers the goal as “the Great Work,” with rubedo as completion. But “completion” is often defined as:

Stable integration of insight into action  
A durable ethical/disciplinary transformation  
A capacity to operate in alignment with a chosen metaphysical order

So rubedo is treated as “attainment,” not merely a chemical endpoint.

### Planets, metals, and the stage logic

A common occult overlay is the **seven classical planets ↔ seven metals**, used to structure practice cycles:

Sun ↔ gold  
Moon ↔ silver  
Mars ↔ iron  
Venus ↔ copper  
Mercury ↔ quicksilver  
Jupiter ↔ tin  
Saturn ↔ lead

In many esoteric readings, the “stages” are also navigated as planetary initiations (often starting with Saturn/lead as a nigredo analogue and culminating with Sun/gold as a rubedo analogue). This is interpretive and varies widely.

### “Solve et coagula” as ritual technology

In occult practice, solve/coagula is frequently operationalized as:

Dissolve: banishing, stripping constructs, undoing bindings, shadow work, fasting/silence, deconditioning  
Coagulate: consecration, oath, talismanic fixation, disciplined habit, embodiment in craft

The “substance” being transformed is the practitioner’s patterning, not necessarily a laboratory mixture.

## Crosswalk: same vocabulary, different referents

| Term | Laboratory referent | Jungian referent | Occult referent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nigredo | decomposition/putrefaction; dark phase in vessel | collapse of ego story; shadow confrontation | Saturnine purification; ordeal/initiatory descent |
| Albedo | washing/clarification; whitening signs | differentiation; reflective clarity | cleansing/banishing; purification rites |
| Citrinitas | maturation/dawning; sometimes distinct | stabilized illumination; new orientation | solarization; awakening/gnosis emerging |
| Rubedo | fixation/completion; stable medicine | integration and embodiment | attainment; stabilized “Work” in life/ritual |
| Solve/Coagula | dissolve/fix cyclic operations | destabilize/reform identity | deconstruct/reconsecrate self and environment |

## Practical guidance on “which stage model to use”

If you are doing actual lab-adjacent practice, treat stages as **observable signs + repeatable operations**, not a rigid checklist. If you are doing Jungian work, treat stages as **recurring psychological cycles** with integration as the only meaningful “completion.” If you are using occult summaries, treat stages as a **ritualized curriculum**—useful for discipline—while remembering it is a modern synthesis.

If you want, I can map your phrase “a recurring, recursive root dissolves & coagulates” directly onto all three models as a single shared formal schema (inputs → transformations → observables → failure modes), using your preferred variable/placeholder style (e.g., $STAGE, $OPERATION, $SIGN, $INTEGRATION_STATE).
